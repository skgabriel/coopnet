the brain is composed of many different brain regions, each of which is connected via a network of neurons . in order to understand how these connections are organized, we need to know the spatial and temporal patterns that are observed in these connections . this is the domain of functional connectivity (fc), a mathematical approach that analyzes information in the brain's spatiotemporal and temporal patterns . the aim of this work is to show that fc can be used to study the spatiotemporal and temporal patterns that are observed in functional connections, as well as the temporal correlations between these patterns . in particular, we show that the fc method can distinguish between the two kinds of temporal correlations that are common to functional and anatomical connections: those between the temporal correlations
connectivity in the brain has been extensively studied in a number of different ways: anatomical and functional networks, time-varying signals, and temporal dynamics . however, the underlying processes underlying the connectivity are poorly understood . in this work, we develop a new method that combines both the statistical and the temporal aspects of connectivity in order to study the temporal dynamics of the connectivity between different brain structures . our approach is based on the theory of information theory and allows the identification of causal relationships between different time series of different brain structures . we show that the analysis of temporal dynamics is a powerful tool for the identification, quantification, and interpretation of causal relationships in the connectivity between different brain structures . our results suggest that temporal dynamics can provide a useful framework for studying
connectivity is a fundamental concept in neuroscience . the ability to link brain regions is fundamental for the functioning of the nervous system, and it is a central topic for the treatment of epilepsy and other neurodegenerative disorders . however, the exact nature of these links remains unclear . in this work, we study the correlation between the spatiotemporal patterns of functional connectivity and the spatiotemporal patterns of the functional connectivity in a network of neurons . we find that the correlation is highly correlated with the temporal correlation between the functional connectivity and a single neuron's firing rate, which is the most important parameter . this correlation is not affected by the spatial correlation between neurons, which is a characteristic characteristic of a single neuron . the correlation is also not affected by
