we present a novel kinetic model for amyloid assembly and degradation in a bulk in vitro experiment . the model is based on the kinetic behaviour of amyloid aggregates and fibrils, and the model can be extended to incorporate the variability of nucleation dynamics . we show that the model is robust to the stochasticity of nucleation dynamics and that the variability in nucleation dynamics can be quantified by using the mean time-dependent (mtdd) model . we show that the mean time-dependent (mtdd) model can be used to estimate the time required for the nucleation process to occur . our model is also applicable to the experimental measurements of amyloid formation and degradation in a bulk microfluidic experiment .
we present a novel deterministic kinetic model of protein assembly into amyloid, a protein that exhibits a stochastic behaviour and a large variability in its lag phase length, which may be due to the stochastic nature of the nucleation process . our model is based on the kinetic dynamics of a protein that is a polymer of monomeric peptides, and is coupled to the stochastic growth of amyloid particles, which are the result of the nucleation reaction between the polymer and the nucleation substrate . the model has been successfully applied to experimental data, including microfluidic experiments in pl to nl, where it has been found that the lag phase length varies with the protein concentration . we show that the observed variability
the amyloid protein assembly process is a key step in the formation of amyloid fibrils . in the presence of a protein concentration that is higher than normal, the polymerization process proceeds slowly and rapidly with an average rate of about 1/10th of the initial rate . the amyloid fibril formation kinetics are described by a deterministic model that incorporates the effects of the protein concentration, and the nucleation rate . we show that this deterministic model can be used to predict the average lag phase length and the number of rare nucleation events in the presence of different concentrations, which are in the range of hundreds of l . we also show that this prediction can be used to predict the average length of the lag phase
