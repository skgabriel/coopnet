we present a simple statistical model for the evolution of a population of mutants . it is shown that the probability of fixation depends on the size of the population, on the fitness function of each individual and on the fitness function of the population as a whole, and on the relative fitness of the individuals in the population . the model is based on a simple model of natural selection, and the resulting model is a useful framework for understanding the relationship between selection and drift in evolution .The first thing to know about this game is that it is a game of luck, not skill.<|TL;DR|>we have created a game where players try to win as much as possible by luck, not by skill, and we call it luckless games (lg) . lg
we study the probability of fixation for a population of genes in which mutation is sufficiently weak that each new mutation is either lost or fixed before the next new mutation enters the population . we derive a simple formulae for this probability, which is a function of both the magnitude of selection and the form of genetic drift . we show that this formulae provides a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the two, and that the standard formulae for the fixation probability are, mathematically, difficult . we also discuss the implications of our results for models of evolution under weak selection .This is a simple example of how a simple class can be used as an object in a game. It is an example of a class called a class, which is a
we consider a simple model in which a single mutant allele is fixed by natural selection and a new one is introduced into the population by a process of genetic drift . the model assumes that mutations enter the population with random distributions of selection coefficients and that each new mutant is fixed independently from all other mutants . in order to obtain a general estimate of the probability that the new mutant allele is fixed, we use a simple mathematical model of the evolution of populations, where each individual has a random probability of fixation . we find that, for the simplest case in which the population is small, the probability of fixation is . for the larger cases, the probability of fixation is . we then show that this simple model can capture the complexity of the evolutionary process . we also discuss
