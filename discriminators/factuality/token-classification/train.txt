We B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
maintenance B-LOC
of B-LOC
protective B-LOC
T B-LOC
cell B-LOC

is B-LOC
associated B-LOC
with B-LOC
persistent B-LOC
LAV B-LOC

the B-LOC

node, B-LOC
which B-LOC
occurs B-LOC
almost B-LOC
exclusively B-LOC
in B-LOC
follicular B-LOC
helper B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC
effective B-LOC

maintain B-LOC
lymphoid B-LOC
tissue-based, B-LOC

T B-LOC

and, B-LOC
if B-LOC
present B-LOC
in B-LOC
sufficient B-LOC

can B-LOC
completely B-LOC
control B-LOC
and B-LOC
perhaps B-LOC
clear B-LOC
infection, B-LOC
an B-LOC
observation B-LOC
that B-LOC
provides B-LOC
a B-LOC
rationale B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
development B-LOC
of B-LOC

safe, B-LOC
persistent B-LOC

that B-LOC

Multicellular B-LOC

Many B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathways B-LOC
that B-LOC
mediate B-LOC
this B-LOC
cell B-LOC
removal B-LOC
are B-LOC
conserved B-LOC
through B-LOC
evolution. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
identify B-LOC
srgp-1 B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
negative B-LOC
regulator B-LOC
of B-LOC
cell B-LOC
clearance B-LOC
in B-LOC
both B-LOC
Caenorhabditis B-LOC

and B-LOC
mammalian B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
Loss B-LOC
of B-LOC
srgp-1 B-LOC
function B-LOC
results B-LOC
in B-LOC
improved B-LOC
engulfment B-LOC
of B-LOC
apoptotic B-LOC
cells, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
srgp-1 B-LOC
overexpression B-LOC
inhibits B-LOC
apoptotic B-LOC

corpse B-LOC
removal. B-LOC
We O
show O
that O
SRGP-1 O
functions O
in O
engulfing O
cells O
and O
functions O
as O
a O
GTPase O
activating O

protein O
(GAP) O
for O
CED-10 O
(Rac1). O
Interestingly, O
loss O
of O
srgp-1 O
function O
promotes O
not O
only O
the O
clearance O
of O
already O
dead O
cells, O
but O
also O
the O
removal O
of O

that O
have O
been O
brought O
to O
the O

of O
death O
through O
sublethal O
apoptotic, O
necrotic O
or O

insults. O
In B-LOC
contrast, B-LOC
impaired B-LOC
engulfment B-LOC
allows B-LOC
damaged B-LOC
cells B-LOC
to B-LOC
escape B-LOC
clearance, B-LOC
which B-LOC
results B-LOC
in B-LOC
increased B-LOC
long-term B-LOC
survival. B-LOC
We B-LOC
propose B-LOC
that B-LOC
C. B-LOC
elegans B-LOC
uses B-LOC
the B-LOC
engulfment B-LOC
machinery B-LOC
as B-LOC
part B-LOC
of B-LOC
a B-LOC
primitive, B-LOC
but B-LOC
evolutionarily B-LOC

conserved, B-LOC
survey B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
that B-LOC

removes B-LOC
unfit B-LOC

within B-LOC
a B-LOC

Seizures B-LOC

Despite B-LOC

Unlike B-LOC

Lymphocytes B-LOC

However, B-LOC
the B-LOC

the B-LOC

LDL B-LOC

might B-LOC
help B-LOC

We B-LOC
therefore B-LOC
did B-LOC
a B-LOC
genome-wide B-LOC

study B-LOC
of B-LOC
LDL-cholesterol B-LOC

METHODS B-LOC
We B-LOC
used B-LOC
genome-wide B-LOC

from B-LOC
up B-LOC

11,685 B-LOC

We B-LOC

We B-LOC
did B-LOC

in B-LOC
two B-LOC
independent B-LOC

Statistical B-LOC

were B-LOC
used B-LOC
to B-LOC
refine B-LOC

we B-LOC
analysed B-LOC

FINDINGS B-LOC
In B-LOC
our B-LOC
initial B-LOC

we B-LOC
found B-LOC
two B-LOC
SNPs B-LOC
(rs599839 B-LOC
[p=1.7x10(-15)] B-LOC
and B-LOC
rs4970834 B-LOC
[p=3.0x10(-11)]) B-LOC
that B-LOC
showed B-LOC
genome-wide B-LOC
statistical B-LOC
association B-LOC
with B-LOC
LDL B-LOC

at B-LOC
chromosomal B-LOC

The B-LOC

found B-LOC
a B-LOC

statistically B-LOC
associated B-LOC
SNP B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC

(rs646776 B-LOC

[p=4.3x10(-9)]). B-LOC
Meta-analysis B-LOC
of B-LOC
data B-LOC
from B-LOC
all B-LOC

showed B-LOC
an B-LOC

rs599839 B-LOC
(combined B-LOC

SNPs B-LOC
rs599839 B-LOC
and B-LOC
rs646776 B-LOC
both B-LOC
explained B-LOC

1% B-LOC

the B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
We B-LOC
found B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
for B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
locus B-LOC
for B-LOC
LDL B-LOC
cholesterol B-LOC
on B-LOC

1p13.3. B-LOC
These B-LOC
results B-LOC
potentially B-LOC
provide B-LOC
insight B-LOC
into B-LOC
the B-LOC
biological B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
that B-LOC
underlie B-LOC
the B-LOC
regulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
LDL B-LOC
cholesterol B-LOC
and B-LOC
might B-LOC
help B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
discovery B-LOC
of B-LOC
novel B-LOC
therapeutic B-LOC
targets B-LOC
for B-LOC
cardiovascular B-LOC
disease. B-LOC

Chemokines B-LOC

and B-LOC
by B-LOC
activating B-LOC
integrins B-LOC
in B-LOC
order B-LOC
to B-LOC
induce B-LOC
cell B-LOC
adhesion. B-LOC
Analyzing B-LOC
dendritic B-LOC
cell B-LOC
(DC) B-LOC
migration, B-LOC
we B-LOC
showed B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
cellular B-LOC
responses B-LOC
depended B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
mode B-LOC
of B-LOC
chemokine B-LOC
presentation B-LOC
within B-LOC
tissues. B-LOC
The B-LOC
surface-immobilized B-LOC
form B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
chemokine B-LOC
CCL21, B-LOC

that B-LOC
was B-LOC
confined B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC

chemokine-presenting B-LOC
surface B-LOC
because B-LOC
it B-LOC
triggered B-LOC
integrin-mediated B-LOC
adhesion. B-LOC
Upon B-LOC
direct B-LOC
contact B-LOC
with B-LOC
CCL21, B-LOC
DCs B-LOC
truncated B-LOC
the B-LOC
anchoring B-LOC
residues B-LOC
of B-LOC
CCL21, B-LOC
thereby B-LOC
releasing B-LOC
it B-LOC
from B-LOC

Soluble O

Both B-LOC
soluble B-LOC
CCR7 B-LOC

triggered B-LOC
chemotactic B-LOC

but B-LOC
not B-LOC

Adhesive B-LOC

Circadian B-LOC
cycles B-LOC
and B-LOC
cell B-LOC
cycles B-LOC
are B-LOC
two B-LOC
fundamental B-LOC
periodic B-LOC
processes B-LOC
with B-LOC
a B-LOC
period B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
range B-LOC
of B-LOC
1 B-LOC
day. B-LOC
Consequently, B-LOC
coupling B-LOC
between B-LOC
such B-LOC
cycles B-LOC
can B-LOC
lead B-LOC
to B-LOC
synchronization. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
estimated B-LOC
the B-LOC
mutual B-LOC
interactions B-LOC
between B-LOC
the B-LOC
two B-LOC
oscillators B-LOC
by B-LOC
time-lapse B-LOC
imaging B-LOC
of B-LOC
single B-LOC
mammalian B-LOC
NIH3T3 B-LOC
fibroblasts B-LOC
during B-LOC
several B-LOC
days. B-LOC
The O
analysis O

that O

In B-LOC
principle, B-LOC
such B-LOC
synchrony B-LOC
may B-LOC
be B-LOC
caused B-LOC
by B-LOC
either B-LOC
unidirectional B-LOC
or B-LOC
bidirectional B-LOC
coupling. B-LOC
While B-LOC
gating B-LOC
of B-LOC
cell B-LOC
division B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
circadian B-LOC
cycle B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
most B-LOC
studied, B-LOC
our B-LOC
data B-LOC
combined B-LOC
with B-LOC
stochastic B-LOC
modeling B-LOC
unambiguously B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
reverse B-LOC
coupling B-LOC
is B-LOC
predominant B-LOC
in B-LOC
NIH3T3 B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
Moreover, B-LOC
temperature, B-LOC
genetic, B-LOC
and B-LOC
pharmacological B-LOC
perturbations B-LOC
showed B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
two B-LOC
interacting B-LOC
cellular B-LOC
oscillators B-LOC
adopt B-LOC
a B-LOC
synchronized B-LOC
state B-LOC
that B-LOC
is B-LOC
highly B-LOC
robust B-LOC
over B-LOC
a B-LOC
wide B-LOC
range B-LOC
of B-LOC
parameters. B-LOC

These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
have B-LOC
implications B-LOC
for B-LOC

The B-LOC

Among B-LOC

Granulomas B-LOC
are B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathological B-LOC
hallmark B-LOC
of B-LOC
tuberculosis B-LOC
(TB). B-LOC
However, B-LOC
their B-LOC
function B-LOC
and B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
of B-LOC
formation B-LOC
remain B-LOC
poorly B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
To B-LOC
understand B-LOC
the B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
granulomas B-LOC
in B-LOC
TB, B-LOC
we B-LOC
analyzed B-LOC
the B-LOC
proteomes B-LOC
of B-LOC
granulomas B-LOC
from B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
with B-LOC
tuberculosis B-LOC
in B-LOC
an B-LOC
unbiased B-LOC
manner. B-LOC
Using B-LOC
laser-capture B-LOC
microdissection, B-LOC
mass B-LOC
spectrometry B-LOC
and B-LOC
confocal B-LOC
microscopy, B-LOC
we B-LOC
generated B-LOC
detailed B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
maps B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
granulomas. B-LOC
We O
found O
that O
the O
centers O
of O
granulomas O
have O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
environment O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
antimicrobial O

peptides, O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
and O
pro-inflammatory O
eicosanoids. O
Conversely, O
the O
tissue O
surrounding O
the O
caseum O
has O
a O
comparatively O
anti-inflammatory O
signature. O
These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
are B-LOC
consistent B-LOC
across B-LOC
a B-LOC
set B-LOC
of B-LOC
six B-LOC
human B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
and B-LOC
in B-LOC
rabbits. B-LOC
Although O
the O
balance O
between O
systemic O
pro- O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
signals O
is O
crucial O
to O
TB O
disease O
outcome, O
here O
we O
find O
that O
these O
signals O
are O
physically O
segregated O
within O
each O
granuloma. O
From B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein B-LOC
and B-LOC
lipid B-LOC
snapshots B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
and B-LOC
rabbit B-LOC

analyzed B-LOC
here, B-LOC
we B-LOC

hypothesize B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathologic B-LOC
response B-LOC
to B-LOC
TB B-LOC
is B-LOC
shaped B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC

We B-LOC
used B-LOC

examine B-LOC
whether B-LOC
mechanical B-LOC

We B-LOC

hESCs B-LOC
accumulate B-LOC

In B-LOC

the B-LOC

Although B-LOC

this B-LOC

The B-LOC
most B-LOC
conspicuous B-LOC
event B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
cell B-LOC
cycle B-LOC
is B-LOC
the B-LOC
alignment B-LOC
of B-LOC
chromosomes B-LOC
in B-LOC
metaphase. B-LOC
Chromosome B-LOC
alignment B-LOC
fosters B-LOC
faithful B-LOC

through B-LOC
the B-LOC

bi-oriented B-LOC

Notably, B-LOC
numerous B-LOC
kinetochore-microtubule B-LOC
(k-MT) B-LOC
attachment B-LOC
errors B-LOC
are B-LOC
present B-LOC
in B-LOC
early B-LOC
mitosis B-LOC
(prometaphase), B-LOC
and B-LOC
the B-LOC
persistence B-LOC
of B-LOC
those B-LOC
errors B-LOC
is B-LOC
the B-LOC
leading B-LOC
cause B-LOC
of B-LOC
chromosome B-LOC
mis-segregation B-LOC
in B-LOC
aneuploid B-LOC
human B-LOC
tumour B-LOC
cells B-LOC
that B-LOC
continually B-LOC
mis-segregate B-LOC
whole B-LOC

and B-LOC
display B-LOC
chromosomal B-LOC
instability. B-LOC
How B-LOC
robust B-LOC

is B-LOC
achieved B-LOC
in B-LOC
prometaphase B-LOC
to B-LOC
ensure B-LOC
error-free B-LOC

Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
k-MT B-LOC
attachments B-LOC
in B-LOC
prometaphase B-LOC
cells B-LOC
are B-LOC
considerably B-LOC
less B-LOC
stable B-LOC
than B-LOC
in B-LOC
metaphase B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
The O
switch O
to O
more O
stable O
k-MT O

in O
metaphase O
requires O
the O
proteasome-dependent O
destruction O
of O

in O
prometaphase. O
Persistent O
cyclin O
A O

prevents O
k-MT O

even O

By O
contrast, O
k-MTs O
are O
prematurely O
stabilized O
in O

cyclin-A-deficient O
cells. O
Consequently, B-LOC
cells B-LOC
lacking B-LOC
cyclin B-LOC
A B-LOC
display B-LOC
higher B-LOC
rates B-LOC
of B-LOC
chromosome B-LOC
mis-segregation. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
the B-LOC
stability B-LOC
of B-LOC
k-MT B-LOC
attachments B-LOC
increases B-LOC
decisively B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
coordinated B-LOC
fashion B-LOC
among B-LOC
all B-LOC
chromosomes B-LOC
as B-LOC
cells B-LOC
transit B-LOC
from B-LOC
prometaphase B-LOC
to B-LOC
metaphase. B-LOC
Cyclin B-LOC
A B-LOC
creates B-LOC
a B-LOC
cellular B-LOC
environment B-LOC
that B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
microtubule B-LOC
detachment B-LOC
from B-LOC
kinetochores B-LOC
in B-LOC
prometaphase B-LOC

Results B-LOC

Together, B-LOC
these B-LOC

that B-LOC

Immune B-LOC

result B-LOC
in B-LOC
impressive B-LOC
clinical B-LOC
responses, B-LOC
but B-LOC
optimal B-LOC
results B-LOC
will B-LOC
require B-LOC
combination B-LOC
with B-LOC
each B-LOC
other B-LOC
and B-LOC
other B-LOC
therapies. B-LOC
This B-LOC
raises B-LOC
fundamental B-LOC
questions B-LOC
about B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
of B-LOC
non-redundancy B-LOC
and B-LOC
resistance. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
report B-LOC
major B-LOC
tumour B-LOC
regressions B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
subset B-LOC
of B-LOC
patients B-LOC
with B-LOC
metastatic B-LOC
melanoma B-LOC
treated B-LOC
with B-LOC
an B-LOC
anti-CTLA4 B-LOC
antibody B-LOC
(anti-CTLA4) B-LOC
and B-LOC
radiation, B-LOC
and B-LOC
reproduced B-LOC
this B-LOC
effect B-LOC
in B-LOC
mouse B-LOC
models. B-LOC
Although B-LOC
combined B-LOC
treatment B-LOC
improved B-LOC
responses B-LOC
in B-LOC
irradiated B-LOC
and B-LOC
unirradiated B-LOC
tumours, B-LOC
resistance B-LOC
was B-LOC
common. B-LOC
Unbiased O
analyses O
of O
mice O
revealed O

that O
resistance O
was O
due O
to O
upregulation O
of O
PD-L1 O
on O
melanoma O
cells O
and O
associated O
with O
T-cell O
exhaustion. O
Accordingly, B-LOC
optimal B-LOC
response B-LOC
in B-LOC
melanoma B-LOC
and B-LOC
other B-LOC
cancer B-LOC
types B-LOC
requires B-LOC
radiation, B-LOC
anti-CTLA4 B-LOC
and B-LOC
anti-PD-L1/PD-1. B-LOC
Anti-CTLA4 B-LOC
predominantly B-LOC
inhibits B-LOC
T-regulatory B-LOC
cells B-LOC
(Treg B-LOC
cells), B-LOC
thereby B-LOC
increasing B-LOC
the B-LOC
CD8 B-LOC
T-cell B-LOC
to B-LOC
Treg B-LOC
(CD8/Treg) B-LOC
ratio. B-LOC
Radiation B-LOC
enhances B-LOC
the B-LOC
diversity B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
T-cell B-LOC
receptor B-LOC
(TCR) B-LOC
repertoire B-LOC
of B-LOC
intratumoral B-LOC
T B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
Together, B-LOC

anti-CTLA4 B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
expansion B-LOC
of B-LOC
T B-LOC
cells, B-LOC
while B-LOC
radiation B-LOC
shapes B-LOC
the B-LOC
TCR B-LOC
repertoire B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
expanded B-LOC
peripheral B-LOC
clones. B-LOC
Addition B-LOC
of B-LOC
PD-L1 B-LOC
blockade B-LOC
reverses B-LOC
T-cell B-LOC
exhaustion B-LOC
to B-LOC
mitigate B-LOC
depression B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
CD8/Treg B-LOC
ratio B-LOC
and B-LOC
further B-LOC
encourages B-LOC
oligoclonal B-LOC
T-cell B-LOC
expansion. B-LOC
Similarly B-LOC
to B-LOC
results B-LOC
from B-LOC
mice, B-LOC
patients B-LOC
on B-LOC
our B-LOC
clinical B-LOC
trial B-LOC
with B-LOC
melanoma B-LOC
showing B-LOC
high B-LOC
PD-L1 B-LOC
did B-LOC
not B-LOC

to B-LOC
radiation B-LOC
plus B-LOC
anti-CTLA4, B-LOC
demonstrated B-LOC
persistent B-LOC
T-cell B-LOC
exhaustion, B-LOC
and B-LOC
rapidly B-LOC
progressed. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
PD-L1 B-LOC
on B-LOC

melanoma B-LOC
cells B-LOC
allows B-LOC
tumours B-LOC
to B-LOC
escape B-LOC
anti-CTLA4-based B-LOC
therapy, B-LOC
and B-LOC
the B-LOC
combination B-LOC
of B-LOC
radiation, B-LOC
anti-CTLA4 B-LOC
and B-LOC
anti-PD-L1 B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
response B-LOC
and B-LOC
immunity B-LOC
through B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
mechanisms. B-LOC

Furthermore, B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
The B-LOC
widely B-LOC
held B-LOC
assumptions B-LOC
that B-LOC
blood B-LOC

has B-LOC
strong B-LOC
associations B-LOC
with B-LOC
the B-LOC
occurrence B-LOC
of B-LOC
all B-LOC
cardiovascular B-LOC
diseases B-LOC
across B-LOC
a B-LOC
wide B-LOC
age B-LOC
range, B-LOC
and B-LOC
that B-LOC
diastolic B-LOC
and B-LOC
systolic B-LOC
associations B-LOC
are B-LOC
concordant, B-LOC
are B-LOC
not B-LOC
supported B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
findings B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC

Despite B-LOC
modern B-LOC
treatments, B-LOC
the B-LOC
lifetime B-LOC

These B-LOC

emphasise B-LOC
the B-LOC
need B-LOC
for B-LOC
new B-LOC

Our B-LOC

In B-LOC
2010, B-LOC

Antiretroviral B-LOC

has B-LOC
substantial B-LOC
potential B-LOC
to B-LOC
prevent B-LOC
HIV-associated B-LOC

We B-LOC

Summary. B-LOC

Telomeres B-LOC
resemble B-LOC
common B-LOC
fragile B-LOC
sites B-LOC
(CFSs) B-LOC
in B-LOC
that B-LOC
they B-LOC
are B-LOC
difficult-to-replicate B-LOC
and B-LOC
exhibit B-LOC
fragility B-LOC
in B-LOC
mitosis B-LOC
in B-LOC
response B-LOC
to B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
replication B-LOC
stress. B-LOC
At O
CFSs, O
this O
fragility O
is O
associated O
with O
a O
delay O
in O
the O
completion O

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
this B-LOC

DNA B-LOC
synthesis B-LOC
(MiDAS) B-LOC
is B-LOC
also B-LOC
a B-LOC
feature B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
telomeres. B-LOC
Telomeric B-LOC
MiDAS B-LOC
is B-LOC
not B-LOC
restricted B-LOC
to B-LOC
those B-LOC

telomeres B-LOC
displaying B-LOC
overt B-LOC

is B-LOC
a B-LOC

whether B-LOC
their B-LOC

or B-LOC

the B-LOC
alternative B-LOC

mechanism. B-LOC
MiDAS B-LOC
at B-LOC
telomeres B-LOC
requires B-LOC
RAD52, B-LOC
and B-LOC
is B-LOC
mechanistically B-LOC
similar B-LOC

CFS-associated B-LOC
MiDAS, B-LOC
with B-LOC
the B-LOC
notable B-LOC
exception B-LOC
that B-LOC
telomeric B-LOC
MiDAS B-LOC
does B-LOC
not B-LOC
require B-LOC
the B-LOC

We O
propose O
a O
model O
whereby O

The B-LOC
helicase B-LOC
RTEL1 B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
t-loop B-LOC

suppresses B-LOC
telomere B-LOC
fragility B-LOC
to B-LOC
maintain B-LOC
the B-LOC

of B-LOC
vertebrate B-LOC
telomeres. B-LOC
An B-LOC
interaction B-LOC
between B-LOC
RTEL1 B-LOC
and B-LOC
PCNA B-LOC
is B-LOC
important B-LOC
to B-LOC
prevent B-LOC
telomere B-LOC
fragility, B-LOC
but B-LOC
how B-LOC
RTEL1 B-LOC
engages B-LOC
with B-LOC
the B-LOC
telomere B-LOC
to B-LOC
promote B-LOC
t-loop B-LOC
unwinding B-LOC
is B-LOC
unclear. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
establish B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
shelterin B-LOC
protein B-LOC
TRF2 B-LOC
recruits B-LOC
RTEL1 B-LOC
to B-LOC
telomeres B-LOC
in B-LOC
S B-LOC
phase, B-LOC
which B-LOC
is B-LOC
required B-LOC
to B-LOC
prevent B-LOC
catastrophic B-LOC
t-loop B-LOC
processing B-LOC
by B-LOC
structure-specific B-LOC

nucleases. B-LOC
We O
show O
that O
the O
TRF2-RTEL1 O
interaction O
is O
mediated O
by O
a O
metal-coordinating O
C4C4 O
motif O
in O
RTEL1, O
which O
is O
compromised O
by O
the O
Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson O

(HHS) O
mutation, O
RTEL1(R1264H). O
Conversely, B-LOC
we B-LOC
define B-LOC
a B-LOC
TRF2(I124D) B-LOC
substitution B-LOC
mutation B-LOC
within B-LOC
the B-LOC
TRFH B-LOC
domain B-LOC
of B-LOC
TRF2, B-LOC
which B-LOC
eliminates B-LOC
RTEL1 B-LOC
binding B-LOC
and B-LOC
phenocopies B-LOC
the B-LOC
RTEL1(R1264H) B-LOC
mutation, B-LOC
giving B-LOC

heterogeneity, B-LOC
and B-LOC
loss B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
telomere B-LOC
as B-LOC

These B-LOC
results B-LOC
implicate B-LOC

tissue-resident B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
in B-LOC

Here, O
we O
show O
that O
cardiac O
macrophages O
facilitate O
electrical O

through O
the O
distal O
atrioventricular O
node, O
where O
conducting O

When B-LOC

Conversely, O

The B-LOC

its B-LOC

We B-LOC
show B-LOC
here B-LOC
that B-LOC
Mfge8 B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
the B-LOC

Mechanistically, O

Collectively, B-LOC

a B-LOC

ARID1A B-LOC

Therapeutic B-LOC
approaches B-LOC

this B-LOC
genetic B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
HDAC6 B-LOC

Inhibition O

This B-LOC

The B-LOC

HDAC6 B-LOC

in B-LOC
ARID1A-mutated B-LOC

correlated B-LOC

a B-LOC

ARID1A. B-LOC
HDAC6 B-LOC

HDAC6 B-LOC

deacetylates B-LOC
Lys120 B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC

Together, B-LOC
these B-LOC

indicate B-LOC
that B-LOC

HDAC6 B-LOC

a B-LOC

Using B-LOC
in B-LOC

we B-LOC
show B-LOC
here B-LOC
that B-LOC

CONCLUSIONS B-LOC

reuptake B-LOC
inhibitors B-LOC
and B-LOC
drugs B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
group B-LOC
of B-LOC

associated B-LOC
with B-LOC
an B-LOC
increased B-LOC
risk B-LOC
of B-LOC
several B-LOC
adverse B-LOC
outcomes B-LOC
compared B-LOC
with B-LOC
tricyclic B-LOC
antidepressants. B-LOC
Among B-LOC
individual B-LOC
drugs, B-LOC
trazodone, B-LOC
mirtazapine, B-LOC
and B-LOC
venlafaxine B-LOC
were B-LOC
associated B-LOC
with B-LOC
the B-LOC
highest B-LOC

for B-LOC
some B-LOC

outcomes. B-LOC
As B-LOC
this B-LOC

it B-LOC
is B-LOC
susceptible B-LOC
to B-LOC
confounding B-LOC
by B-LOC
indication, B-LOC

residual B-LOC
confounding, B-LOC
so B-LOC
differences B-LOC

patients B-LOC
prescribed B-LOC

the B-LOC

between B-LOC
the B-LOC
drugs B-LOC

the B-LOC

may B-LOC
remain. B-LOC
Further B-LOC
research B-LOC
is B-LOC
needed B-LOC

these B-LOC
findings, B-LOC
but B-LOC
the B-LOC
risks B-LOC

Osteogenesis B-LOC
during B-LOC
bone B-LOC
modeling B-LOC
and B-LOC
remodeling B-LOC
is B-LOC
coupled B-LOC
with B-LOC
angiogenesis. B-LOC
A B-LOC
recent B-LOC
study B-LOC
showed B-LOC
that B-LOC
a B-LOC

vessel B-LOC
subtype, B-LOC
strongly B-LOC
positive B-LOC

CD31 B-LOC
and B-LOC
endomucin B-LOC
(CD31hiEmcnhi), B-LOC
couples B-LOC

and B-LOC
osteogenesis. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
platelet-derived B-LOC
growth B-LOC
factor-BB B-LOC
(PDGF-BB) B-LOC
secreted B-LOC
by B-LOC
preosteoclasts B-LOC
induces B-LOC

In B-LOC

CD31hiEmcnhi B-LOC

are B-LOC

Treatment B-LOC
with B-LOC
exogenous B-LOC

PDGF-BB B-LOC
or B-LOC
inhibition B-LOC
of B-LOC
cathepsin B-LOC
K B-LOC
to B-LOC
increase B-LOC
the B-LOC
number B-LOC
of B-LOC
preosteoclasts, B-LOC
and B-LOC
thus B-LOC
the B-LOC
endogenous B-LOC
levels B-LOC
of B-LOC
PDGF-BB, B-LOC
increases B-LOC
CD31hiEmcnhi B-LOC
vessel B-LOC
number B-LOC
and B-LOC
stimulates B-LOC
bone B-LOC
formation B-LOC
in B-LOC
OVX B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC
pharmacotherapies B-LOC
that B-LOC
increase B-LOC
PDGF-BB B-LOC
secretion B-LOC
from B-LOC
preosteoclasts B-LOC
offer B-LOC
a B-LOC

treating B-LOC
osteoporosis B-LOC

Although B-LOC
iPSCs B-LOC

they B-LOC
frequently B-LOC
exhibit B-LOC

Here, B-LOC

The B-LOC
canonical B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
messenger B-LOC
RNA B-LOC
(mRNA) B-LOC
is B-LOC
to B-LOC
deliver B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
information B-LOC
to B-LOC
sites B-LOC
of B-LOC
protein B-LOC
synthesis. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
given B-LOC
that B-LOC
microRNAs B-LOC
bind B-LOC
to B-LOC
RNAs, B-LOC
we B-LOC
hypothesized B-LOC
that B-LOC
RNAs B-LOC
could B-LOC
possess B-LOC
a B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
role B-LOC
that B-LOC
relies B-LOC
on B-LOC
their B-LOC
ability B-LOC
to B-LOC
compete B-LOC
for B-LOC
microRNA B-LOC
binding, B-LOC
independently B-LOC
of B-LOC
their B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
function. B-LOC
As B-LOC
a B-LOC
model B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein-coding-independent B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
RNAs, B-LOC
we B-LOC
describe B-LOC
the B-LOC
functional B-LOC
relationship B-LOC
between B-LOC
the B-LOC
mRNAs B-LOC
produced B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
PTEN B-LOC
tumour B-LOC
suppressor B-LOC
gene B-LOC
and B-LOC
its B-LOC
pseudogene B-LOC
PTENP1 B-LOC
and B-LOC
the B-LOC
critical B-LOC
consequences B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC

interaction. B-LOC
We O
find O
that O
PTENP1 O
is O
biologically O
active O
as O
it O
can O
regulate O
cellular O
levels O
of O
PTEN O
and O
exert O
a O
growth-suppressive O
role. O
We B-LOC
also B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
PTENP1 B-LOC
locus B-LOC
is B-LOC
selectively B-LOC
lost B-LOC
in B-LOC
human B-LOC
cancer. B-LOC
We B-LOC
extended B-LOC
our B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
to B-LOC
other B-LOC
cancer-related B-LOC
genes B-LOC
that B-LOC
possess B-LOC
pseudogenes, B-LOC
such B-LOC
as B-LOC
oncogenic B-LOC
KRAS. B-LOC
We B-LOC
also B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
transcripts B-LOC
of B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
genes B-LOC
such B-LOC
as B-LOC
PTEN B-LOC
are B-LOC
biologically B-LOC
active. B-LOC
These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
attribute B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
biological B-LOC
role B-LOC
to B-LOC
expressed B-LOC
pseudogenes, B-LOC
as B-LOC
they B-LOC
can B-LOC
regulate B-LOC

coding B-LOC
gene B-LOC
expression, B-LOC
and B-LOC
reveal B-LOC
a B-LOC

Given B-LOC

Interestingly, B-LOC
the B-LOC

However, B-LOC

Moreover, B-LOC

However, B-LOC
many B-LOC

Although B-LOC

the B-LOC

is B-LOC
well B-LOC
established, B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
becoming B-LOC
clear B-LOC
that B-LOC
nuclear B-LOC

also B-LOC
regulate B-LOC
the B-LOC

Nevertheless, B-LOC
a B-LOC

Here, O
we O

Interestingly, B-LOC

which B-LOC
induces B-LOC

Remarkably, B-LOC

Our B-LOC

Cytogenetic B-LOC

show B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC

as B-LOC
subchromosomal B-LOC

but B-LOC
the B-LOC

Moreover, B-LOC

We B-LOC

We B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
chromosomes B-LOC
can B-LOC
be B-LOC
segmented B-LOC
into B-LOC
multimegabase B-LOC
domains B-LOC
of B-LOC

which B-LOC
we B-LOC
call B-LOC
"replication B-LOC

regions B-LOC
whose B-LOC
replication B-LOC

are B-LOC
consistent B-LOC
with B-LOC
large B-LOC

The B-LOC
molecular B-LOC

are B-LOC
remarkably B-LOC

between B-LOC

Unexpectedly, B-LOC

was B-LOC
accompanied B-LOC

We B-LOC
conclude B-LOC
that B-LOC
replication B-LOC

are B-LOC
cell-type B-LOC
specific, B-LOC
and B-LOC
changes B-LOC
in B-LOC
these B-LOC

reveal B-LOC

Moreover, B-LOC
smaller B-LOC

a B-LOC

In B-LOC
the B-LOC
yeast B-LOC
Saccharomyces B-LOC

genetic B-LOC
studies B-LOC
suggest B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
gene B-LOC
encodes B-LOC
a B-LOC
positive B-LOC
regulator B-LOC
of B-LOC
meiosis. B-LOC
rim1 O

IME1, O

We B-LOC
report B-LOC
the B-LOC
sequence B-LOC
of B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
and B-LOC
functional B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
of B-LOC
its B-LOC
coding B-LOC
region. B-LOC
The B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
gene B-LOC
product B-LOC
(RIM1) B-LOC
contains B-LOC
three B-LOC
regions B-LOC
similar B-LOC
to B-LOC
C2H2 B-LOC
zinc B-LOC

Serine B-LOC
substitutions B-LOC
for B-LOC
cysteine B-LOC
in B-LOC
each B-LOC
of B-LOC

the B-LOC
putative B-LOC
zinc B-LOC
fingers B-LOC
abolish B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC

The B-LOC
carboxyl-terminus B-LOC
of B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
is B-LOC
enriched B-LOC
in B-LOC
acidic B-LOC
amino B-LOC
acids B-LOC
and B-LOC
is B-LOC
required B-LOC
for B-LOC
full B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
activity. B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
also B-LOC
contains B-LOC
two B-LOC
putative B-LOC
cAMP-dependent B-LOC
protein B-LOC
kinase B-LOC
(cAPK) B-LOC
phosphorylation B-LOC
sites. B-LOC
At B-LOC
one B-LOC
site, B-LOC
substitution B-LOC
of B-LOC
alanine B-LOC
for B-LOC
serine B-LOC
does B-LOC
not B-LOC
affect B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
activity; B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
other B-LOC
site, B-LOC
this B-LOC
substitution B-LOC
impairs B-LOC
activity. B-LOC
This B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
of B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein B-LOC
may B-LOC
function B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
transcriptional B-LOC
activator. B-LOC
We B-LOC
have B-LOC
used B-LOC
the B-LOC

cloned B-LOC
RIM1 B-LOC
gene B-LOC
to B-LOC
create B-LOC
a B-LOC
complete B-LOC
rim1 B-LOC
deletion. B-LOC
This B-LOC
null B-LOC
allele, B-LOC
like B-LOC
previously B-LOC
isolated B-LOC
rim1 B-LOC
mutations, B-LOC
causes B-LOC
a B-LOC
partial B-LOC
meiotic B-LOC
defect. B-LOC
In B-LOC
addition B-LOC
to B-LOC
RIM1, B-LOC
maximum B-LOC
IME1 B-LOC
expression B-LOC
requires B-LOC
the B-LOC
MCK1 B-LOC

Defects B-LOC

a B-LOC
meiotic B-LOC

gene B-LOC
(ime2-lacZ) B-LOC

This B-LOC

mediated B-LOC
primarily B-LOC
through B-LOC
the B-LOC

We B-LOC

Both B-LOC

STAT4-deficient B-LOC

Treatment B-LOC

the B-LOC

On B-LOC

CONCLUSIONS B-LOC
IL-12/IL-12R/STAT4 B-LOC

In O

The B-LOC

The B-LOC

serves B-LOC
as B-LOC
an B-LOC
important B-LOC

from B-LOC

Still, B-LOC
however, B-LOC
little B-LOC
is B-LOC
known B-LOC
about B-LOC
the B-LOC
components B-LOC

ERAD B-LOC

Here O
we O

that O
the O

RHBDL4 O
is O
a O
ubiquitin-dependent O
ER-resident O
intramembrane O

RHBDL4 O
cleaves O

with O

unstable O

leading O

RHBDL4 B-LOC
specifically B-LOC
binds B-LOC
the B-LOC
AAA+-ATPase B-LOC

suggesting B-LOC
that B-LOC
proteolytic B-LOC
processing B-LOC

relationship B-LOC
between B-LOC
rhomboids B-LOC
and B-LOC
the B-LOC
ERAD B-LOC

suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC
substrates B-LOC
for B-LOC
intramembrane B-LOC
proteolysis B-LOC
and B-LOC

are B-LOC
recruited B-LOC

Mitochondria O

Additionally, O
they O

Given B-LOC
these B-LOC
well-established B-LOC
functions, B-LOC
it B-LOC
might B-LOC
be B-LOC
expected B-LOC
that B-LOC
mitochondrial B-LOC
dysfunction B-LOC

However, B-LOC
mitochondrial B-LOC

Clearly, B-LOC
much B-LOC

OBJECTIVE B-LOC
Although B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polypill B-LOC
concept B-LOC
(proposed B-LOC

2003) B-LOC
is B-LOC
promising B-LOC
in B-LOC
terms B-LOC
of B-LOC
benefits B-LOC
for B-LOC
cardiovascular B-LOC
risk B-LOC
management, B-LOC
the B-LOC
potential B-LOC
costs B-LOC
and B-LOC
adverse B-LOC
effects B-LOC
are B-LOC
its B-LOC
main B-LOC
pitfalls. B-LOC
The B-LOC
objective B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC
study B-LOC
was B-LOC
to B-LOC
identify B-LOC
a B-LOC
tastier B-LOC
and B-LOC
safer B-LOC
alternative B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polypill: B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polymeal. B-LOC
METHODS B-LOC
Data B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
ingredients B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polymeal B-LOC
were B-LOC
taken B-LOC

RESULTS B-LOC
Combining B-LOC
the B-LOC
ingredients B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polymeal B-LOC
would B-LOC
reduce B-LOC
cardiovascular B-LOC

Therefore, B-LOC

Activation B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
mammalian B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
receptor B-LOC
after B-LOC
ligand B-LOC
binding B-LOC
relies B-LOC
on B-LOC
a B-LOC
succession B-LOC
of B-LOC
events B-LOC
including B-LOC
metalloprotease-cleavage, B-LOC
endocytosis, B-LOC
monoubiquitination, B-LOC
and B-LOC
eventually B-LOC
processing B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
gamma-secretase, B-LOC
giving B-LOC
rise B-LOC
to B-LOC
a B-LOC
soluble, B-LOC
transcriptionally B-LOC
active B-LOC
molecule. B-LOC
The B-LOC
Notch1 B-LOC
receptor B-LOC
was B-LOC
proposed B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
monoubiquitinated B-LOC
before B-LOC
its B-LOC
gamma-secretase B-LOC
cleavage; B-LOC
the B-LOC
targeted B-LOC
lysine B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
localized B-LOC
to B-LOC
its B-LOC
submembrane B-LOC
domain. B-LOC
Investigating B-LOC
how B-LOC
this B-LOC
step B-LOC
might B-LOC
be B-LOC
regulated B-LOC
by B-LOC
a B-LOC
deubiquitinase B-LOC
(DUB) B-LOC

activity B-LOC
will B-LOC
provide B-LOC
new B-LOC
insight B-LOC
for B-LOC
understanding B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
receptor B-LOC
activation B-LOC
and B-LOC
downstream B-LOC

An B-LOC
immunofluorescence-based B-LOC
screening B-LOC
of B-LOC
an B-LOC
shRNA B-LOC
library B-LOC
allowed B-LOC
us B-LOC
to B-LOC
identify B-LOC
eIF3f, B-LOC
previously B-LOC
known B-LOC
as B-LOC
one B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
subunits B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
translation B-LOC
initiation B-LOC
factor B-LOC
eIF3, B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
DUB B-LOC
targeting B-LOC
the B-LOC
activated B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
receptor. B-LOC
We B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
eIF3f B-LOC
has B-LOC
an B-LOC
intrinsic B-LOC
DUB B-LOC
activity. B-LOC
Knocking B-LOC
down B-LOC
eIF3f B-LOC
leads B-LOC
to B-LOC
an B-LOC
accumulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
monoubiquitinated B-LOC
forms B-LOC

Notch, B-LOC
an B-LOC

counteracted B-LOC

murine B-LOC
WT B-LOC

eIF3f B-LOC
but B-LOC
not B-LOC
by B-LOC
a B-LOC
catalytically B-LOC
inactive B-LOC
mutant. B-LOC
We O
also O
show O
that O
eIF3f O
is O
recruited O
to O
activated O
Notch O
on O

by O
the O
putative O

a B-LOC

of B-LOC
the B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
pathway. B-LOC
Our B-LOC
results B-LOC
support B-LOC
two B-LOC
new B-LOC
and B-LOC

provocative B-LOC
conclusions: B-LOC
(1) B-LOC
The B-LOC
activated B-LOC
form B-LOC
of B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
needs B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
deubiquitinated B-LOC
before B-LOC
being B-LOC
processed B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
gamma-secretase B-LOC
activity B-LOC
and B-LOC
entering B-LOC
the B-LOC
nucleus, B-LOC
where B-LOC
it B-LOC
fulfills B-LOC
its B-LOC
transcriptional B-LOC
function. B-LOC
(2) B-LOC
The B-LOC
enzyme B-LOC
accounting B-LOC
for B-LOC
this B-LOC
deubiquitinase B-LOC
activity B-LOC
is B-LOC
eIF3f, B-LOC
known B-LOC
so B-LOC
far B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
translation B-LOC
initiation B-LOC
factor. B-LOC
These B-LOC
data B-LOC
improve B-LOC
our B-LOC
knowledge B-LOC
of B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
signaling B-LOC
but B-LOC
also B-LOC
open B-LOC
new B-LOC
avenues B-LOC
of B-LOC
research B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
Zomes B-LOC

but B-LOC
how B-LOC

Here, O
we O
show O
that O
all O
colorectal O

(CR-CSCs) O
express O
CD44v6, O
which O
is O
required O
for O
their O
migration O
and O
generation O
of O
metastatic O
tumors. O
CD44v6 B-LOC
expression B-LOC
is B-LOC

in B-LOC

but B-LOC

increase O
CD44v6 O
expression O
in O
CR-CSCs O
by O
activating O
the O
Wnt/β-catenin O
pathway, O
which O
promotes O
migration O
and O
metastasis. O
CD44v6(-) O
progenitor O
cells O
do O
not O
give O
rise O
to O
metastatic O
lesions O
but, O
when O
treated O
with O
cytokines, O
acquire O
CD44v6 O
expression O
and O
metastatic O
capacity. O
Importantly, O
phosphatidylinositol O

(PI3K) O

selectively O
killed O
CD44v6 O

and O
reduced O

In B-LOC
patient B-LOC
cohorts, B-LOC
low B-LOC
levels B-LOC
of B-LOC
CD44v6 B-LOC
predict B-LOC
increased B-LOC
probability B-LOC

Thus, O
the O
metastatic O
process O
in O
colorectal O
cancer O
is O
initiated O
by O
CSCs O
through O
the O
expression O
of O
CD44v6, O

Thus, B-LOC
this B-LOC
study B-LOC
reveals B-LOC
a B-LOC
pathogenic B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
and B-LOC
a B-LOC
potential B-LOC
intervention B-LOC

enables B-LOC
the B-LOC

tumor B-LOC

gene B-LOC
to B-LOC
regulate B-LOC
their B-LOC
transcription B-LOC
and B-LOC
cell-cycle B-LOC

Using B-LOC
genome-wide B-LOC
chromatin-binding B-LOC

we B-LOC
describe B-LOC
binding B-LOC

also B-LOC
to B-LOC
regions B-LOC
located B-LOC
distantly B-LOC
from B-LOC
any B-LOC

Interestingly, B-LOC
many B-LOC

these B-LOC

p53-binding B-LOC
sites B-LOC
and B-LOC
all B-LOC

We B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC
p53-bound B-LOC

regions B-LOC
(p53BERs) B-LOC
indeed B-LOC
contain B-LOC

Furthermore, O

Thus, B-LOC
our B-LOC

Hence, B-LOC

How B-LOC

respond B-LOC
to B-LOC
mechanical B-LOC
forces B-LOC
is B-LOC
of B-LOC
considerable B-LOC
interest B-LOC
to B-LOC
biologists B-LOC
as B-LOC
force B-LOC
affects B-LOC
many B-LOC
aspects B-LOC
of B-LOC
cell B-LOC
behaviour. B-LOC
The B-LOC
application B-LOC

on B-LOC

also B-LOC
known B-LOC

Although B-LOC
RhoA B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
shown B-LOC
to B-LOC
play B-LOC
a B-LOC
role B-LOC
during B-LOC
reinforcement, B-LOC
the B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
that B-LOC
regulate B-LOC
its B-LOC

are B-LOC
unknown. B-LOC
By O

we O

GEF-H1, O

We B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
stimulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
integrins B-LOC
with B-LOC
tensional B-LOC
force B-LOC
triggers B-LOC
activation B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
two B-LOC

Surprisingly, B-LOC
activation B-LOC
of B-LOC
LARG B-LOC
and B-LOC
GEF-H1 B-LOC
involves B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
signalling B-LOC
pathways. B-LOC
Our B-LOC

reveal B-LOC
that B-LOC
LARG B-LOC
is B-LOC
activated B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
Src B-LOC

tyrosine B-LOC

Fyn, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC

Previous B-LOC

Because B-LOC

Using B-LOC

The B-LOC
Maf B-LOC
oncoproteins B-LOC
are B-LOC
b-Zip B-LOC
transcription B-LOC
factors B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

superfamily. B-LOC
They B-LOC
are B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
developmental, B-LOC
metabolic, B-LOC

tumorigenic B-LOC
processes. B-LOC
Maf B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
are B-LOC
overexpressed B-LOC
in B-LOC
about B-LOC
50% B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
multiple B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
Maf-transforming B-LOC
activity B-LOC
is B-LOC
controlled B-LOC
by B-LOC
GSK-3-dependent B-LOC
phosphorylation B-LOC
and B-LOC
that B-LOC
phosphorylation B-LOC
by B-LOC
GSK-3 B-LOC
can B-LOC
increase B-LOC
the B-LOC
oncogenic B-LOC
activity B-LOC
of B-LOC
a B-LOC
protein. B-LOC
Using B-LOC
microarray B-LOC

we B-LOC
identify B-LOC
a B-LOC
gene-expression B-LOC
subprogram B-LOC
regulated B-LOC
by B-LOC

GSK-3-mediated B-LOC
Maf B-LOC
phosphorylation B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC

remodeling B-LOC
and B-LOC
relevant B-LOC
to B-LOC
cancer B-LOC
progression. B-LOC
We O
also O
demonstrate O
that O
GSK-3 O
triggers O
MafA O
sequential O
phosphorylation O
on O
residues O
S61, O
T57, O
T53, O
and O
S49, O
inducing O
its O

Paradoxically, O
this O
phosphorylation O
increases O
MafA-transcriptional O
activity O
through O
the O

of O
the O
coactivator O
P/CAF. O
We B-LOC
further B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
P/CAF B-LOC
protects B-LOC
MafA B-LOC

from B-LOC
ubiquitination B-LOC
and B-LOC
degradation, B-LOC
suggesting B-LOC
that, B-LOC
upon B-LOC
the B-LOC
release B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
coactivator B-LOC
complex, B-LOC
MafA B-LOC
becomes B-LOC
polyubiquitinated B-LOC

degraded B-LOC
to B-LOC
allow B-LOC

We B-LOC

whether B-LOC

The B-LOC
importance B-LOC
of B-LOC
neuropeptides B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC

has B-LOC
been B-LOC
experimentally B-LOC
established. B-LOC
Due B-LOC
to B-LOC
difficulties B-LOC
in B-LOC
assessing B-LOC

in B-LOC

the B-LOC
roles B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
fast-acting B-LOC
neurotransmitters B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
and B-LOC
GABA B-LOC
are B-LOC
largely B-LOC

Synaptic B-LOC
vesicular B-LOC
transporters B-LOC
(VGLUTs B-LOC
for B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
and B-LOC

for B-LOC

are B-LOC
required B-LOC
for B-LOC
vesicular B-LOC
uptake B-LOC
and, B-LOC
consequently, B-LOC
synaptic B-LOC
release B-LOC
of B-LOC
neurotransmitters. B-LOC
Ventromedial B-LOC
hypothalamic B-LOC
(VMH) B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
are B-LOC
predominantly B-LOC
glutamatergic B-LOC
and B-LOC
express B-LOC

VGLUT2. B-LOC
To B-LOC

the B-LOC

we B-LOC

These B-LOC

The B-LOC

a B-LOC
haematopoietic B-LOC

which B-LOC

During B-LOC
the B-LOC

the B-LOC

the B-LOC

Similarly B-LOC

Here, O
we O

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC

discuss B-LOC

principles B-LOC
of B-LOC

that B-LOC
contribute B-LOC

Historically, B-LOC
the B-LOC
ribosome B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
viewed B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
complex B-LOC
ribozyme B-LOC
with B-LOC
constitutive B-LOC
rather B-LOC
than B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
capacity B-LOC
in B-LOC
mRNA B-LOC
translation. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
identify B-LOC
mutations B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
Ribosomal B-LOC
Protein B-LOC
L38 B-LOC
(Rpl38) B-LOC
gene B-LOC
in B-LOC

including B-LOC
pronounced B-LOC

of B-LOC
the B-LOC
axial B-LOC
skeleton. B-LOC
In O
Rpl38 O
mutant O
embryos, O
global O

is O
unchanged; O
however O
the O

Our B-LOC

reveal B-LOC
that B-LOC
RPL38 B-LOC
facilitates B-LOC

on B-LOC

We B-LOC
further B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
Rpl38 B-LOC
expression B-LOC
is B-LOC
markedly B-LOC
enriched B-LOC
in B-LOC
regions B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

face B-LOC
environmental B-LOC
challenges B-LOC
that B-LOC
they B-LOC
separately B-LOC
cannot. B-LOC
One B-LOC
particular B-LOC
challenge B-LOC
that B-LOC
is B-LOC
important B-LOC
for B-LOC
microorganisms B-LOC
is B-LOC
migration. B-LOC
In B-LOC
this B-LOC
study, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
how B-LOC
flagellum-independent B-LOC
migration B-LOC
is B-LOC
driven B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
division B-LOC
of B-LOC
labor B-LOC
of B-LOC
two B-LOC
cell B-LOC
types B-LOC
that B-LOC
appear B-LOC
during B-LOC
Bacillus B-LOC
subtilis B-LOC
sliding B-LOC
motility. B-LOC
Cell B-LOC
collectives B-LOC
organize B-LOC
themselves B-LOC
into B-LOC
bundles B-LOC
(called B-LOC
"van B-LOC
Gogh B-LOC
bundles") B-LOC
of B-LOC
tightly B-LOC
aligned B-LOC
cell B-LOC
chains B-LOC
that B-LOC
form B-LOC
filamentous B-LOC
loops B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
colony B-LOC
edge. B-LOC
We B-LOC
show, B-LOC

by B-LOC
time-course B-LOC
microscopy, B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC
loops B-LOC
migrate B-LOC
by B-LOC
pushing B-LOC
themselves B-LOC
away B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
colony. B-LOC
The O
formation O
of O
van O
Gogh O
bundles O
depends O
critically O
on O
the O
synergistic O
interaction O
of O
surfactin-producing O
and O
matrix-producing O
cells. O
We O
propose O
that O
surfactin-producing O
cells O
reduce O
the O
friction O
between O
cells O
and O
their O
substrate, O
thereby O
facilitating O
matrix-producing O
cells O
to O
form O
bundles. O
The B-LOC
folding B-LOC
properties B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
bundles B-LOC
determine B-LOC
the B-LOC
rate B-LOC
of B-LOC
colony B-LOC
expansion. B-LOC
Our B-LOC
study B-LOC
illustrates B-LOC
how B-LOC
the B-LOC
simple B-LOC
organization B-LOC
of B-LOC
cells B-LOC
within B-LOC
a B-LOC
community B-LOC
can B-LOC
yield B-LOC
a B-LOC
strong B-LOC
ecological B-LOC
advantage. B-LOC
This B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC

key B-LOC
factor B-LOC
underlying B-LOC
the B-LOC
diverse B-LOC
origins B-LOC
of B-LOC
multicellularity. B-LOC

Despite B-LOC
accumulating B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
suggesting B-LOC
local B-LOC
self-maintenance B-LOC
of B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
steady B-LOC
state, B-LOC
the B-LOC
dogma B-LOC
remains B-LOC
that B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
derive B-LOC
from B-LOC
monocytes. B-LOC
Using B-LOC
parabiosis B-LOC
and B-LOC
fate-mapping B-LOC
approaches, B-LOC
we B-LOC
confirmed B-LOC
that B-LOC
monocytes B-LOC
do B-LOC
not B-LOC
show B-LOC
significant B-LOC
contribution B-LOC
to B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
steady B-LOC
state. B-LOC
Similarly, B-LOC
we B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
after B-LOC
depletion B-LOC
of B-LOC
lung B-LOC
macrophages, B-LOC
the B-LOC
majority B-LOC
of B-LOC
repopulation B-LOC
occurred B-LOC
by B-LOC
stochastic B-LOC
cellular B-LOC
proliferation B-LOC
in B-LOC
situ B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
macrophage B-LOC
colony-stimulating B-LOC
factor B-LOC

(M-Csf)- B-LOC
and B-LOC
granulocyte B-LOC
macrophage B-LOC
(GM)-CSF-dependent B-LOC
manner B-LOC
but B-LOC
independently B-LOC
of B-LOC
interleukin-4. B-LOC
We O
also O
found O
that O
after O
bone O
marrow O
transplantation, O
host O
macrophages O
retained O
the O
capacity O
to O
expand O
when O
the O
development O
of O
donor O
macrophages O
was O
compromised. O
Expansion B-LOC
of B-LOC
host B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
was B-LOC
functional B-LOC
and B-LOC
prevented B-LOC
the B-LOC
development B-LOC
of B-LOC
alveolar B-LOC
proteinosis B-LOC
in B-LOC
mice B-LOC
transplanted B-LOC
with B-LOC
GM-Csf-receptor-deficient B-LOC
progenitors. B-LOC
Collectively, B-LOC
these B-LOC
results B-LOC
indicate B-LOC
that B-LOC
tissue-resident B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
and B-LOC

circulating B-LOC
monocytes B-LOC
should B-LOC
be B-LOC
classified B-LOC
as B-LOC
mononuclear B-LOC
phagocyte B-LOC
lineages B-LOC
that B-LOC
are B-LOC
independently B-LOC
maintained B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
steady B-LOC
state. B-LOC

Chronic B-LOC
feeding B-LOC
on B-LOC
high-calorie B-LOC
diets B-LOC
causes B-LOC
obesity B-LOC
and B-LOC
type B-LOC
2 B-LOC
diabetes B-LOC
mellitus B-LOC
(T2DM), B-LOC
illnesses B-LOC
that B-LOC
affect B-LOC
hundreds B-LOC
of B-LOC
millions. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
understanding B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathways B-LOC
protecting B-LOC
against B-LOC
diet-induced B-LOC
metabolic B-LOC
imbalance B-LOC
is B-LOC
of B-LOC
paramount B-LOC
medical B-LOC
importance. B-LOC
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
mice O
lacking O
SIRT1 O
in O
steroidogenic O
factor O
1 O
(SF1) O
neurons O
are O
hypersensitive O
to O
dietary O

Also, O
mutant O
mice O
have O
increased O
susceptibility O
to O
developing O
dietary O
T2DM O
due O
to O

insulin O

in O
skeletal O

Mechanistically, B-LOC
these B-LOC
aberrations B-LOC
arise, B-LOC
in B-LOC
part, B-LOC
from B-LOC
impaired B-LOC
metabolic B-LOC
actions B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
neuropeptide B-LOC
orexin-A B-LOC

the B-LOC

Conversely, O
mice O
overexpressing O

SF1 O
neurons O
are O
more O
resistant O
to O

Both B-LOC

vaginal B-LOC

microorganisms. B-LOC
Vaccination O
through O
large O
intestinal O
mucosa, O
previously O
proven O
protective O
for O
both O
of O
these O
mucosal O
sites O
in O
animal O
studies, O
can O
be O
achieved O
successfully O
by O
direct O
intracolorectal O
(i.c.r.) O
administration, O
but O
this O
route O
is O
clinically O
impractical. O
Oral B-LOC
vaccine B-LOC
delivery B-LOC
seems B-LOC
preferable B-LOC
but B-LOC
runs B-LOC
the B-LOC
risk B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
vaccine's B-LOC
destruction B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
upper B-LOC
gastrointestinal B-LOC

Therefore, O
we O
designed O
a O
large O
intestine-targeted O
oral O
delivery O
with O

pH-dependent O
microparticles O
containing O
vaccine O
nanoparticles, O
which O
induced O
colorectal O
immunity O
in O
mice O
comparably O
to O
colorectal O
vaccination O
and O
protected O
against O
rectal O
and O
vaginal O
viral O
challenge. O
Conversely, B-LOC
vaccine B-LOC
targeted B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
small B-LOC
intestine B-LOC
induced B-LOC
only B-LOC
small B-LOC
intestinal B-LOC
immunity B-LOC
and B-LOC
provided B-LOC
no B-LOC
rectal B-LOC

vaginal B-LOC
protection, B-LOC
demonstrating B-LOC
functional B-LOC
compartmentalization B-LOC
within B-LOC
the B-LOC
gut B-LOC
mucosal B-LOC
immune B-LOC
system. B-LOC
Therefore, O
using O
this O
oral O
vaccine O
delivery O
system O
to O
target O
the O
large O
intestine, O
but O
not O
the O
small O
intestine, O
may O
represent O
a O

feasible O
new O
strategy O
for O
immune O
protection O
of O
rectal O
and O

BACKGROUND B-LOC
Self-harm B-LOC

Furthermore, B-LOC

followed B-LOC
by B-LOC

this B-LOC

We B-LOC

In B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
The B-LOC

Self-harm B-LOC

varies B-LOC
enormously B-LOC
between B-LOC

This B-LOC

the B-LOC

a B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
exploit B-LOC

to B-LOC
gain B-LOC
insight B-LOC
into B-LOC
the B-LOC

Blimp1 O
(Prdm1), O

which B-LOC

Whereas B-LOC
Prdm14 B-LOC

is B-LOC
important B-LOC
for B-LOC

it B-LOC

By B-LOC
using B-LOC
a B-LOC

approach, B-LOC
we B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
Blimp1 B-LOC
is B-LOC

Notably, B-LOC
Blimp1 B-LOC
is B-LOC
also B-LOC
dispensable B-LOC
for B-LOC
reprogramming B-LOC
epiSCs B-LOC
to B-LOC
ESCs. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
although B-LOC
Blimp1 B-LOC
is B-LOC
obligatory B-LOC
for B-LOC
PGC B-LOC
specification, B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
not B-LOC
required B-LOC

the B-LOC

to B-LOC
ESCs B-LOC
and B-LOC
for B-LOC
their B-LOC
maintenance B-LOC
thereafter. B-LOC
This B-LOC
study B-LOC
suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC
reprogramming, B-LOC
including B-LOC
that B-LOC
of B-LOC

somatic B-LOC

This B-LOC

suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC

be B-LOC
protective B-LOC
but B-LOC
a B-LOC

antiretroviral B-LOC
drugs B-LOC
may B-LOC
be B-LOC
required B-LOC
to B-LOC
increase B-LOC
the B-LOC
level B-LOC
of B-LOC
protection. B-LOC
Short B-LOC

PrEP B-LOC

Background B-LOC
Celiac B-LOC
disease B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
small B-LOC
intestinal B-LOC
inflammatory B-LOC
disorder B-LOC
characterized B-LOC
by B-LOC
malabsorption, B-LOC
nutrient B-LOC
deficiency, B-LOC
and B-LOC
a B-LOC
range B-LOC
of B-LOC
clinical B-LOC

an B-LOC

treated B-LOC

diet. B-LOC
Recent B-LOC

have B-LOC
indicated B-LOC
oats B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
safe B-LOC
for B-LOC
celiac B-LOC

patients, B-LOC
and B-LOC
oats B-LOC
are B-LOC
now B-LOC
often B-LOC
included B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
celiac B-LOC

This B-LOC
study B-LOC
aimed B-LOC
to B-LOC
investigate B-LOC
whether B-LOC
oat B-LOC

exists B-LOC
in B-LOC
celiac B-LOC

and B-LOC
to B-LOC
characterize B-LOC
the B-LOC

underlying B-LOC
this B-LOC

Methods B-LOC

and B-LOC
Findings B-LOC
We B-LOC
selected B-LOC
for B-LOC
study B-LOC
nine B-LOC
adults B-LOC
with B-LOC
celiac B-LOC
disease B-LOC
who B-LOC
had B-LOC
a B-LOC
history B-LOC
of B-LOC
oats B-LOC
exposure. B-LOC
Four B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
patients B-LOC
had B-LOC
clinical B-LOC
symptoms B-LOC
on B-LOC
an B-LOC
oats-containing B-LOC
diet, B-LOC
and B-LOC
three B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
four B-LOC
patients B-LOC
had B-LOC
intestinal B-LOC
inflammation B-LOC
typical B-LOC
of B-LOC
celiac B-LOC
disease B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
time B-LOC
of B-LOC
oats B-LOC

We O
established O
oats-avenin-specific O

-reactive O
intestinal O
T-cell O
lines O
from O
these O
three O
patients, O
as O

The B-LOC

recognized B-LOC
avenin B-LOC

These B-LOC

rich B-LOC
in B-LOC
proline B-LOC

glutamine B-LOC

Deamidation B-LOC

was B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC

Conclusions B-LOC
We B-LOC
conclude B-LOC
that B-LOC
some B-LOC
celiac B-LOC
disease B-LOC
patients B-LOC
have B-LOC
avenin-reactive B-LOC
mucosal B-LOC
T-cells B-LOC
that B-LOC
can B-LOC
cause B-LOC
mucosal B-LOC

Oat B-LOC

We B-LOC
used B-LOC

We B-LOC
obtained B-LOC
information B-LOC
about B-LOC
mortality B-LOC
from B-LOC
all B-LOC
sites. B-LOC
For B-LOC
participants B-LOC
who B-LOC
had B-LOC
died, B-LOC
we B-LOC
interviewed B-LOC
a B-LOC

that B-LOC
they B-LOC
had B-LOC

FINDINGS B-LOC
12,887 B-LOC

The B-LOC

Taken B-LOC

in B-LOC
the B-LOC

We B-LOC

BACKGROUND B-LOC
Interleukin B-LOC
(IL)-18 B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
potent B-LOC
proinflammatory B-LOC
cytokine B-LOC
with B-LOC
potential B-LOC
atherogenic B-LOC
properties. B-LOC
Its B-LOC
expression B-LOC
and B-LOC
role B-LOC
in B-LOC
atherosclerosis, B-LOC
however, B-LOC
are B-LOC
unknown. B-LOC
METHODS B-LOC
AND B-LOC
RESULTS B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC

study, B-LOC
we B-LOC
examined B-LOC

also B-LOC
upregulated B-LOC
in B-LOC
plaque B-LOC

suggesting B-LOC
potential B-LOC
biological B-LOC

To B-LOC
examine B-LOC
the B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
IL-18 B-LOC
in B-LOC

we B-LOC
determined B-LOC
the B-LOC

BACKGROUND B-LOC

Individuals O

We B-LOC

In B-LOC

the B-LOC

not B-LOC

has B-LOC
increased B-LOC
overall, B-LOC

Many B-LOC
human B-LOC
cells B-LOC
can B-LOC
sense B-LOC
the B-LOC
presence B-LOC
of B-LOC
exogenous B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
during B-LOC
infection B-LOC
though B-LOC
the B-LOC
cytosolic B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
receptor B-LOC
cyclic B-LOC
GMP-AMP B-LOC
synthase B-LOC
(cGAS), B-LOC
which B-LOC
produces B-LOC
the B-LOC
second B-LOC
messenger B-LOC
cyclic B-LOC
GMP-AMP B-LOC
(cGAMP). B-LOC
Other B-LOC
putative B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
receptors B-LOC
have B-LOC
been B-LOC
described, B-LOC
but B-LOC
whether B-LOC
their B-LOC
functions B-LOC
are B-LOC
redundant, B-LOC
tissue-specific B-LOC
or B-LOC
integrated B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
cGAS-cGAMP B-LOC
pathway B-LOC
is B-LOC
unclear. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
interferon-γ B-LOC
inducible B-LOC
protein B-LOC
16 B-LOC
(IFI16) B-LOC
cooperates B-LOC
with B-LOC
cGAS B-LOC
during B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
sensing B-LOC
in B-LOC

human B-LOC
keratinocytes, B-LOC
as B-LOC
both B-LOC
cGAS B-LOC
and B-LOC
IFI16 B-LOC
are B-LOC
required B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
full B-LOC
activation B-LOC
of B-LOC
an B-LOC
innate B-LOC
immune B-LOC
response B-LOC
to B-LOC
exogenous B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
and B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
viruses. B-LOC
IFI16 O
is O

STING, O

We B-LOC
propose B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
two B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
sensors B-LOC
IFI16 B-LOC
and B-LOC
cGAS B-LOC
cooperate B-LOC
to B-LOC
prevent B-LOC
the B-LOC

of B-LOC
the B-LOC

Human B-LOC
tumors B-LOC
show B-LOC
a B-LOC
high B-LOC
level B-LOC
of B-LOC
genetic B-LOC
heterogeneity, B-LOC
but B-LOC
the B-LOC
processes B-LOC
that B-LOC
influence B-LOC
the B-LOC
timing B-LOC
and B-LOC
route B-LOC
of B-LOC
metastatic B-LOC
dissemination B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

are B-LOC
unknown. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
have B-LOC
used B-LOC
whole-exome B-LOC
sequencing B-LOC

103 B-LOC

benign, B-LOC
malignant B-LOC
and B-LOC
metastatic B-LOC
skin B-LOC
tumors B-LOC
from B-LOC
genetically B-LOC
heterogeneous B-LOC

to B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
most B-LOC

disseminate B-LOC
synchronously B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
primary B-LOC
tumor, B-LOC
supporting B-LOC
parallel B-LOC
rather B-LOC
than B-LOC
linear B-LOC
evolution B-LOC
as B-LOC
the B-LOC
predominant B-LOC

of B-LOC
metastasis. B-LOC
Shared B-LOC
mutations B-LOC
between B-LOC
primary B-LOC
carcinomas B-LOC
and B-LOC
their B-LOC

have B-LOC

the B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
A-to-T B-LOC
signature B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
initiating B-LOC
carcinogen B-LOC
dimethylbenzanthracene, B-LOC
but B-LOC
non-shared B-LOC
mutations B-LOC
are B-LOC
primarily B-LOC
G-to-T, B-LOC
a B-LOC
signature B-LOC
associated B-LOC
with B-LOC
oxidative B-LOC
stress. B-LOC
The B-LOC
existence B-LOC
of B-LOC
carcinomas B-LOC
that B-LOC
either B-LOC
did B-LOC
or B-LOC
did B-LOC
not B-LOC
metastasize B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC

animal B-LOC
suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC
there B-LOC
are B-LOC
tumor-intrinsic B-LOC
factors B-LOC
that B-LOC
influence B-LOC
metastatic B-LOC

We B-LOC
also B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
the B-LOC
importance B-LOC
of B-LOC
germline B-LOC
polymorphisms B-LOC
in B-LOC
determining B-LOC
allele-specific B-LOC

we B-LOC

We B-LOC

transport B-LOC

A B-LOC
key B-LOC

strength. B-LOC
Although B-LOC

hypothesis B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC

also B-LOC

The B-LOC
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like B-LOC
kinase B-LOC
ATM B-LOC
(ataxia-telangiectasia B-LOC

has B-LOC
a B-LOC
central B-LOC
role B-LOC
in B-LOC

responses, B-LOC
including B-LOC
cell-cycle B-LOC

DNA B-LOC

Mutations B-LOC

cause B-LOC
a B-LOC

However, B-LOC
the B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
by B-LOC
which B-LOC
DNA B-LOC

activates B-LOC
ATM B-LOC
is B-LOC
poorly B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
Here O
we O
show O
that O
Cdk5 O

directly O
phosphorylates O

The B-LOC

but B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
unclear B-LOC
whether B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC

distinct B-LOC

are B-LOC
functionally B-LOC
interchangeable B-LOC
or B-LOC
have B-LOC
unique B-LOC
roles B-LOC
at B-LOC
steady B-LOC

This B-LOC
new B-LOC
understanding B-LOC
also B-LOC
prompts B-LOC
reconsideration B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
function B-LOC

circulating B-LOC

Inflammation B-LOC

The B-LOC

demonstrates B-LOC
that B-LOC

Studies B-LOC

Pluripotent B-LOC

In B-LOC
the B-LOC

of B-LOC
ESCs, B-LOC
the B-LOC
genome B-LOC
has B-LOC
an B-LOC
unusual B-LOC

possesses B-LOC
a B-LOC
minimum B-LOC
of B-LOC

In B-LOC
contrast, B-LOC
EpiSCs B-LOC
have B-LOC
activated B-LOC
the B-LOC
epigenetic B-LOC
machinery B-LOC
that B-LOC
supports B-LOC

The B-LOC

from B-LOC

therefore B-LOC
represents B-LOC
a B-LOC

But B-LOC
the B-LOC

remain B-LOC

We O

that O

essential O

for O
ESCs, O

are O
required O

Moreover, O
we O
find O
that O

are O
sufficient O
to O
support O

Our O

Understanding B-LOC

By B-LOC

an B-LOC

in B-LOC
the B-LOC

we B-LOC
discovered B-LOC

a B-LOC
key B-LOC

HLH-30 B-LOC
was B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
absence B-LOC

the B-LOC

As B-LOC
identified B-LOC
initially B-LOC
by B-LOC
co-immunoprecipitation B-LOC
with B-LOC
IL18, B-LOC
we B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC

IL18 B-LOC

with B-LOC
the B-LOC
Na-Cl B-LOC
co-transporter B-LOC
(NCC; B-LOC

An B-LOC

between B-LOC

IL18r B-LOC
on B-LOC

was B-LOC
detected B-LOC

This B-LOC

Traditionally, B-LOC
vaccine B-LOC
development B-LOC
involves B-LOC
tradeoffs B-LOC
between B-LOC
immunogenicity B-LOC
and B-LOC
safety. B-LOC
Live-attenuated B-LOC
vaccines B-LOC
typically B-LOC
offer B-LOC
rapid B-LOC
and B-LOC
durable B-LOC
immunity B-LOC
but B-LOC
have B-LOC
reduced B-LOC
safety B-LOC
when B-LOC
compared B-LOC
to B-LOC
inactivated B-LOC
vaccines. B-LOC
In B-LOC
contrast, B-LOC
the B-LOC
inability B-LOC
of B-LOC
inactivated B-LOC
vaccines B-LOC
to B-LOC
replicate B-LOC
enhances B-LOC
safety B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
expense B-LOC
of B-LOC
immunogenicity, B-LOC
often B-LOC
necessitating B-LOC
multiple B-LOC
doses B-LOC
and B-LOC
boosters. B-LOC
To B-LOC
overcome B-LOC
these B-LOC
tradeoffs, B-LOC
we B-LOC
developed B-LOC
the B-LOC
insect-specific B-LOC
alphavirus, B-LOC
Eilat B-LOC
virus B-LOC
(EILV), B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
vaccine B-LOC

platform. B-LOC
To B-LOC
address B-LOC
the B-LOC
chikungunya B-LOC
fever B-LOC
(CHIKF) B-LOC
pandemic, B-LOC
we B-LOC
used B-LOC
an B-LOC
EILV B-LOC
cDNA B-LOC
clone B-LOC
to B-LOC
design B-LOC
a B-LOC
chimeric B-LOC
virus B-LOC
containing B-LOC
the B-LOC
chikungunya B-LOC
virus B-LOC
(CHIKV) B-LOC
structural B-LOC
proteins. B-LOC
The B-LOC
recombinant B-LOC
EILV/CHIKV B-LOC
was B-LOC
structurally B-LOC
identical B-LOC
at B-LOC
10 B-LOC
Å B-LOC
to B-LOC
wild-type B-LOC
CHIKV, B-LOC
as B-LOC
determined B-LOC
by B-LOC
single-particle B-LOC
cryo-electron B-LOC
microscopy, B-LOC
and B-LOC
it B-LOC
mimicked B-LOC
the B-LOC
early B-LOC
stages B-LOC
of B-LOC

in B-LOC
vertebrate B-LOC

from B-LOC

and B-LOC

Yet B-LOC
the B-LOC
recombinant B-LOC
virus B-LOC
remained B-LOC
completely B-LOC
defective B-LOC
for B-LOC
productive B-LOC
replication, B-LOC
providing B-LOC

To B-LOC
identify B-LOC
previously B-LOC
unknown B-LOC
platelet B-LOC
receptors B-LOC
we B-LOC
compared B-LOC
the B-LOC
transcriptomes B-LOC
of B-LOC
in B-LOC

differentiated B-LOC
megakaryocytes B-LOC
(MKs) B-LOC

obtained B-LOC
from B-LOC
purified, B-LOC
biologically B-LOC
paired B-LOC
MK B-LOC

compared B-LOC
using B-LOC

Bioinformatical B-LOC

MK-up-regulated B-LOC
genes B-LOC
identified B-LOC
151 B-LOC
transcripts B-LOC
encoding B-LOC

Although B-LOC
many B-LOC

a B-LOC
number B-LOC

previously B-LOC
unidentified B-LOC

poorly B-LOC

were B-LOC
also B-LOC

Many B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC

transcripts, B-LOC
including B-LOC
G6b, B-LOC

they B-LOC
may B-LOC
be B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
modulation B-LOC
of B-LOC

Immunoblotting B-LOC

confirmed B-LOC
the B-LOC
presence B-LOC

the B-LOC

G6b, B-LOC

Through O
comparative O
analysis O

we O
demonstrated O
that O
G6b, O

the O

The O

We B-LOC

We B-LOC
assessed B-LOC
the B-LOC
efficacy B-LOC

METHODS B-LOC
Between B-LOC
March, B-LOC
2004, B-LOC
and B-LOC
December, B-LOC
2004, B-LOC
in B-LOC
two B-LOC
separate B-LOC
recruitment B-LOC
phases, B-LOC
women B-LOC
aged B-LOC
25-60 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
randomly B-LOC
assigned B-LOC

in B-LOC
combination B-LOC
with B-LOC
liquid-based B-LOC

cytology B-LOC
(first B-LOC
phase) B-LOC
or B-LOC
alone B-LOC
(second B-LOC

Randomisation B-LOC
was B-LOC
done B-LOC
by B-LOC
computer B-LOC
in B-LOC
two B-LOC
screening B-LOC

and B-LOC
by B-LOC
sequential B-LOC
opening B-LOC
of B-LOC
numbered B-LOC
sealed B-LOC
envelopes B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
remaining B-LOC
seven B-LOC
centres. B-LOC
During B-LOC
phase B-LOC
one, B-LOC
women B-LOC
who B-LOC
were B-LOC
HPV-positive B-LOC
and B-LOC
aged B-LOC
35-60 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
to B-LOC
colposcopy, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
women B-LOC
aged B-LOC
25-34 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
to B-LOC
colposcopy B-LOC
only B-LOC
if B-LOC
cytology B-LOC
was B-LOC
also B-LOC
abnormal B-LOC
or B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
testing B-LOC
was B-LOC
persistently B-LOC
positive. B-LOC
During B-LOC
phase B-LOC
two, B-LOC
women B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
group B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
for B-LOC
colposcopy B-LOC
if B-LOC
the B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
test B-LOC
was B-LOC
positive. B-LOC
Two B-LOC
rounds B-LOC
of B-LOC

screening B-LOC
occurred B-LOC
in B-LOC
each B-LOC
phase, B-LOC
and B-LOC
all B-LOC
women B-LOC
had B-LOC
cytology B-LOC
testing B-LOC
only B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
second B-LOC
round. B-LOC
The B-LOC
primary B-LOC
endpoint B-LOC
was B-LOC
the B-LOC
detection B-LOC
of B-LOC

The B-LOC

However, B-LOC

We B-LOC

However, B-LOC
given B-LOC
the B-LOC

the B-LOC

In B-LOC

In B-LOC
this B-LOC

we B-LOC
identify B-LOC
three B-LOC

we B-LOC

Compared B-LOC

the B-LOC

We O

that O
the O

We B-LOC
showed B-LOC
that B-LOC

significantly, B-LOC
the B-LOC

up-regulated B-LOC
in B-LOC
various B-LOC

These B-LOC
results B-LOC
further B-LOC
support B-LOC
the B-LOC
hypothesis B-LOC
that B-LOC
pregnancy B-LOC

important B-LOC
modifiers B-LOC
of B-LOC
subsequent B-LOC

Resistance B-LOC

apoptosis, B-LOC
often B-LOC
achieved B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
overexpression B-LOC

antiapoptotic B-LOC
proteins, B-LOC
is B-LOC
common B-LOC
and B-LOC
perhaps B-LOC
required B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
genesis B-LOC
of B-LOC
cancer. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
it B-LOC
remains B-LOC
uncertain B-LOC
whether B-LOC
apoptotic B-LOC
defects B-LOC
are B-LOC
essential B-LOC
for B-LOC
tumor B-LOC
maintenance. B-LOC
To B-LOC
test B-LOC
this, B-LOC
we B-LOC
generated B-LOC
mice B-LOC
expressing B-LOC
a B-LOC

Loss B-LOC

this B-LOC

These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
indicated B-LOC
that B-LOC
A20 B-LOC
is B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
tumorigenesis B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
glioma, B-LOC

may B-LOC
serve B-LOC

a B-LOC

As B-LOC
organisms B-LOC
develop, B-LOC
their B-LOC
tissues B-LOC
can B-LOC
become B-LOC
separated B-LOC
into B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
cell B-LOC
populations B-LOC
through B-LOC
the B-LOC
establishment B-LOC
of B-LOC
compartment B-LOC
boundaries. B-LOC
Compartment B-LOC
boundaries B-LOC
have B-LOC
been B-LOC
discovered B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
wide B-LOC
variety B-LOC
of B-LOC
tissues, B-LOC
but B-LOC
in B-LOC
many B-LOC
cases B-LOC
the B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
that B-LOC
separate B-LOC
cells B-LOC
remain B-LOC
poorly B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
Drosophila B-LOC
wing, B-LOC
a B-LOC
stripe B-LOC
of B-LOC
Notch B-LOC
activation B-LOC
maintains B-LOC
the B-LOC
dorsal-ventral B-LOC
compartment B-LOC
boundary, B-LOC
through B-LOC
a B-LOC
process B-LOC
that B-LOC
depends B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
actin B-LOC
cytoskeleton. B-LOC
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
the O
dorsal-ventral O
boundary O
exhibits O
a O
distinct O
accumulation O
of O
Myosin O
II, O
and O
that O
this O
accumulation O
is O
regulated O
downstream O
of O
Notch O

signaling. O
Conversely, B-LOC
the B-LOC
dorsal-ventral B-LOC
boundary B-LOC
is B-LOC
depleted B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
Par-3 B-LOC
homologue B-LOC
Bazooka. B-LOC
We B-LOC
further B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
mutations B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
Myosin B-LOC
heavy B-LOC
chain B-LOC
subunit B-LOC
encoded B-LOC
by B-LOC
zipper B-LOC
can B-LOC
impair B-LOC
dorsal-ventral B-LOC
compartmentalization B-LOC
without B-LOC
affecting B-LOC
anterior-posterior B-LOC
compartmentalization. B-LOC
These B-LOC
observations B-LOC
identify B-LOC
a B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
accumulation B-LOC
and B-LOC
requirement B-LOC
for B-LOC
Myosin B-LOC
activity B-LOC
in B-LOC
dorsal-ventral B-LOC
compartmentalization, B-LOC
and B-LOC
suggest B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
in B-LOC
which B-LOC
contractile B-LOC
tension B-LOC
along B-LOC
an B-LOC
F-actin B-LOC
cable B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
compartment B-LOC
boundary B-LOC
contributes B-LOC
to B-LOC
compartmentalization. B-LOC

The B-LOC
thymic B-LOC
medulla B-LOC
provides B-LOC
a B-LOC
microenvironment B-LOC
where B-LOC
medullary B-LOC
thymic B-LOC
epithelial B-LOC
cells B-LOC
(mTECs) B-LOC
express B-LOC
autoimmune B-LOC
regulator B-LOC
and B-LOC
diverse B-LOC
tissue-restricted B-LOC
genes, B-LOC
contributing B-LOC
to B-LOC
launching B-LOC
self-tolerance. B-LOC
Positive B-LOC
selection B-LOC
is B-LOC
essential B-LOC
for B-LOC
thymic B-LOC
medulla B-LOC
formation B-LOC
via B-LOC
a B-LOC
previously B-LOC
unknown B-LOC
mechanism. B-LOC
Here O
we O
show O
that O
the O
cytokine O
RANK O
ligand O
(RANKL) O
was O
produced O
by O
positively O
selected O
thymocytes O
and O
regulated O
the O
cellularity O

mTEC O

interacting O
with O
RANK O

osteoprotegerin. O
Forced B-LOC

RANKL B-LOC
restored B-LOC
thymic B-LOC
medulla B-LOC
in B-LOC
mice B-LOC
lacking B-LOC
positive B-LOC
selection, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
RANKL B-LOC
perturbation B-LOC
impaired B-LOC
medulla B-LOC
formation. B-LOC
These B-LOC
results B-LOC
indicate B-LOC
that B-LOC
RANKL B-LOC
produced B-LOC
by B-LOC
positively B-LOC
selected B-LOC
thymocytes B-LOC
is B-LOC
responsible B-LOC
for B-LOC
fostering B-LOC

thereby B-LOC

The B-LOC
melanocortin B-LOC

(MC4R) B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
well-established B-LOC

However, B-LOC
the B-LOC
neurotransmitter(s) B-LOC
that B-LOC
mediate B-LOC
MC4R B-LOC
function B-LOC
remain B-LOC
largely B-LOC
unknown; B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
result, B-LOC
little B-LOC
is B-LOC
known B-LOC
about B-LOC
the B-LOC
second-order B-LOC

which B-LOC
include B-LOC
the B-LOC

represent B-LOC
key B-LOC

The B-LOC

The O

completely O
reversed O
by O
selective O
disruption O
of O
glutamate O

from O
those O
same O

The B-LOC
reversal B-LOC
was B-LOC
caused B-LOC
by B-LOC

Corroboratively, O
selective O

Background B-LOC
Macrosomia B-LOC
is B-LOC
associated B-LOC

maternal B-LOC
morbidity. B-LOC
Factors B-LOC
that B-LOC
predict B-LOC
macrosomia B-LOC
are B-LOC
poorly B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
The B-LOC
