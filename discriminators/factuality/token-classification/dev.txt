two B-LOC

Meta-analysis B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
We B-LOC
found B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
for B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
locus B-LOC
for B-LOC
LDL B-LOC
cholesterol B-LOC
on B-LOC

These B-LOC
results B-LOC
potentially B-LOC
provide B-LOC
insight B-LOC
into B-LOC
the B-LOC
biological B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
that B-LOC
underlie B-LOC
the B-LOC
regulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
LDL B-LOC
cholesterol B-LOC
and B-LOC
might B-LOC
help B-LOC

the B-LOC

Methyl-CpG B-LOC
binding B-LOC
protein B-LOC
1 B-LOC
(MBD1) B-LOC
regulates B-LOC
gene B-LOC
expression B-LOC
via B-LOC
a B-LOC
DNA B-LOC
methylation-mediated B-LOC
epigenetic B-LOC
mechanism. B-LOC
We B-LOC
have B-LOC
previously B-LOC
demonstrated B-LOC
that B-LOC
MBD1 B-LOC
deficiency B-LOC
impairs B-LOC
adult B-LOC
neural B-LOC
stem/progenitor B-LOC
cell B-LOC
(aNSC) B-LOC
differentiation B-LOC
and B-LOC
neurogenesis, B-LOC
but B-LOC
the B-LOC
underlying B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
was B-LOC
unclear. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
MBD1 B-LOC
regulates B-LOC
the B-LOC
expression B-LOC
of B-LOC
several B-LOC
microRNAs B-LOC
in B-LOC
aNSCs B-LOC
and, B-LOC
specifically, B-LOC
that B-LOC
miR-184 B-LOC
is B-LOC
directly B-LOC
repressed B-LOC
by B-LOC
MBD1. B-LOC
High O
levels O
of O
miR-184 O
promoted O

proliferation O
but O
inhibited O
differentiation O
of O
aNSCs, O
whereas O
inhibition O
of O
miR-184 O
rescued O
the O
phenotypes O
associated O
with O
MBD1 O
deficiency. O
We B-LOC
further B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
miR-184 B-LOC
regulates B-LOC
the B-LOC
expression B-LOC
of B-LOC
Numblike B-LOC
(Numbl), B-LOC
a B-LOC
known B-LOC
regulator B-LOC
of B-LOC
brain B-LOC
development, B-LOC
by B-LOC
binding B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
3'-UTR B-LOC
of B-LOC
Numbl B-LOC
mRNA B-LOC
and B-LOC
affecting B-LOC
its B-LOC
translation. B-LOC
Expression B-LOC
of B-LOC
exogenous B-LOC
Numbl B-LOC
could B-LOC
rescue B-LOC
the B-LOC
aNSC B-LOC
defects B-LOC
that B-LOC
result B-LOC
from B-LOC
either B-LOC
miR-184 B-LOC
overexpression B-LOC
or B-LOC
MBD1 B-LOC
deficiency. B-LOC

Therefore, B-LOC
MBD1, B-LOC
miR-184, B-LOC
and B-LOC
Numbl B-LOC
form B-LOC
a B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
network B-LOC
that B-LOC
helps B-LOC
control B-LOC
the B-LOC
balance B-LOC
between B-LOC
proliferation B-LOC
and B-LOC
differentiation B-LOC
of B-LOC
aNSCs. B-LOC

Lysine B-LOC

such B-LOC

Thus B-LOC

may B-LOC
be B-LOC
correlated B-LOC

which B-LOC
are B-LOC
termed B-LOC
as B-LOC
the B-LOC

With B-LOC
accumulating B-LOC
studies B-LOC
on B-LOC
proteomic B-LOC
acetylation, B-LOC
lysine B-LOC
acetylation B-LOC
also B-LOC
involves B-LOC
in B-LOC
cell B-LOC

degenerative B-LOC

This B-LOC

and B-LOC

Semaphorin3A B-LOC
(Sema3A) B-LOC
and B-LOC

However, B-LOC
only B-LOC
a B-LOC
subset B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
axonal B-LOC
proteome B-LOC
is B-LOC
locally B-LOC
synthesized, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
most B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
are B-LOC
trafficked B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
soma. B-LOC
The B-LOC
reason B-LOC
why B-LOC
only B-LOC
specific B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
are B-LOC
locally B-LOC
synthesized B-LOC
is B-LOC
unknown. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
local B-LOC
protein B-LOC
synthesis B-LOC
and B-LOC
degradation B-LOC
are B-LOC
linked B-LOC
events B-LOC
in B-LOC
growth B-LOC

We O
find O
that O
growth O

exhibit O
high O
levels O
of O

and O
that O
local O

trigger O

Inhibition B-LOC
of B-LOC
RhoA B-LOC
degradation B-LOC
is B-LOC
sufficient B-LOC
to B-LOC
remove B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein-synthesis B-LOC
requirement B-LOC
for B-LOC
Sema3A-induced B-LOC
growth B-LOC
cone B-LOC
collapse. B-LOC
In B-LOC
addition B-LOC
to B-LOC
RhoA, B-LOC
we B-LOC
find B-LOC
that B-LOC
locally B-LOC
translated B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
are B-LOC
the B-LOC
main B-LOC
targets B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
ubiquitin-proteasome B-LOC
system B-LOC
in B-LOC
growth B-LOC
cones. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
local B-LOC
protein B-LOC
degradation B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
major B-LOC
feature B-LOC
of B-LOC
growth B-LOC
cones B-LOC
and B-LOC
creates B-LOC
a B-LOC

local B-LOC

An B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
genetic B-LOC
factors B-LOC
in B-LOC
obesity B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
carried B-LOC
out B-LOC
on B-LOC
a B-LOC
sample B-LOC
of B-LOC
nuclear B-LOC
families B-LOC
from B-LOC
Aosta B-LOC
(N. B-LOC
Italy). B-LOC
The B-LOC
families B-LOC
consisted B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
parents B-LOC
and B-LOC
sibs B-LOC
of B-LOC
all B-LOC
elementary B-LOC
school B-LOC
children B-LOC
considered B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
obese B-LOC
during B-LOC
a B-LOC
preliminary B-LOC
screening B-LOC
and B-LOC
a B-LOC
similar B-LOC
sample B-LOC
of B-LOC
non-obese B-LOC
children B-LOC
and B-LOC
their B-LOC
nuclear B-LOC
families. B-LOC
The B-LOC
numbers B-LOC
of B-LOC
such B-LOC
families B-LOC
were B-LOC
67 B-LOC
and B-LOC
112, B-LOC
respectively. B-LOC
Several B-LOC
tests B-LOC
were B-LOC
applied B-LOC
in B-LOC
order B-LOC
to B-LOC
examine B-LOC
the B-LOC
genetic B-LOC
contribution B-LOC

and B-LOC
in B-LOC
particular B-LOC
to B-LOC
investigate B-LOC
the B-LOC
presence B-LOC
of B-LOC
a B-LOC
dominant B-LOC
major B-LOC
gene. B-LOC
Our O
conclusions O
are O
that O
genetic O
factors O
are O
certainly O
present. O
Several O
analyses O
suggest O
the O
presence O
of O
a O

dominant O
major O
gene O
with O

effect. O

Granulomas B-LOC
are B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathological B-LOC
hallmark B-LOC
of B-LOC
tuberculosis B-LOC
(TB). B-LOC
However, B-LOC
their B-LOC
function B-LOC
and B-LOC
mechanisms B-LOC
of B-LOC
formation B-LOC
remain B-LOC
poorly B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
To B-LOC
understand B-LOC
the B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
granulomas B-LOC
in B-LOC
TB, B-LOC
we B-LOC
analyzed B-LOC
the B-LOC
proteomes B-LOC
of B-LOC
granulomas B-LOC
from B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
with B-LOC
tuberculosis B-LOC
in B-LOC
an B-LOC
unbiased B-LOC
manner. B-LOC
Using B-LOC
laser-capture B-LOC
microdissection, B-LOC
mass B-LOC
spectrometry B-LOC
and B-LOC
confocal B-LOC
microscopy, B-LOC
we B-LOC
generated B-LOC
detailed B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
maps B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
granulomas. B-LOC
We O
found O
that O
the O
centers O
of O
granulomas O
have O
a O
pro-inflammatory O
environment O
that O
is O
characterized O
by O
the O
presence O
of O
antimicrobial O

peptides, O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
and O
pro-inflammatory O
eicosanoids. O
Conversely, B-LOC
the B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
surrounding B-LOC
the B-LOC
caseum B-LOC
has B-LOC
a B-LOC
comparatively B-LOC
anti-inflammatory B-LOC
signature. B-LOC
These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
are B-LOC
consistent B-LOC
across B-LOC
a B-LOC
set B-LOC
of B-LOC
six B-LOC
human B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
and B-LOC
in B-LOC
rabbits. B-LOC
Although B-LOC
the B-LOC
balance B-LOC
between B-LOC
systemic B-LOC
pro- B-LOC
and B-LOC
anti-inflammatory B-LOC
signals B-LOC
is B-LOC
crucial B-LOC
to B-LOC
TB B-LOC
disease B-LOC
outcome, B-LOC
here B-LOC
we B-LOC
find B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC
signals B-LOC
are B-LOC
physically B-LOC
segregated B-LOC
within B-LOC
each B-LOC
granuloma. B-LOC
From B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein B-LOC
and B-LOC
lipid B-LOC
snapshots B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
and B-LOC
rabbit B-LOC
lesions B-LOC
analyzed B-LOC
here, B-LOC
we B-LOC

hypothesize B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathologic B-LOC
response B-LOC
to B-LOC
TB B-LOC
is B-LOC
shaped B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
precise B-LOC
anatomical B-LOC
localization B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
inflammatory B-LOC
pathways B-LOC
during B-LOC
the B-LOC

Although B-LOC

we B-LOC

Somatic B-LOC

Although B-LOC

In B-LOC

we B-LOC
describe B-LOC

chromosome B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
landscape B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
naive B-LOC
and B-LOC
primed B-LOC
embryonic B-LOC

cells. B-LOC
To B-LOC
devise B-LOC
this B-LOC
map, B-LOC
we B-LOC
identified B-LOC
transcriptional B-LOC
enhancers B-LOC
and B-LOC
insulators B-LOC
in B-LOC
these B-LOC
cells B-LOC
and B-LOC
placed B-LOC
them B-LOC

context B-LOC
of B-LOC
cohesin-associated B-LOC
CTCF-CTCF B-LOC

using B-LOC

ChIA-PET B-LOC
data. B-LOC
The B-LOC
CTCF-CTCF B-LOC
loops B-LOC
we B-LOC
identified B-LOC
form B-LOC
a B-LOC
chromosomal B-LOC
framework B-LOC
of B-LOC
insulated B-LOC
neighborhoods, B-LOC
which B-LOC
in B-LOC
turn B-LOC
form B-LOC
topologically B-LOC
associating B-LOC

(TADs) B-LOC
that B-LOC
are B-LOC
largely B-LOC
preserved B-LOC

The O

These B-LOC
3D B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
maps B-LOC
of B-LOC
human B-LOC
pluripotent B-LOC

therefore B-LOC
provide B-LOC
a B-LOC

One B-LOC
hypothesis B-LOC
that B-LOC
couples B-LOC
infection B-LOC
with B-LOC
autoimmune B-LOC
disease B-LOC
is B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
mimicry. B-LOC
Molecular B-LOC
mimicry B-LOC
is B-LOC
characterized B-LOC
by B-LOC
an B-LOC
immune B-LOC

an B-LOC

that B-LOC
cross-reacts B-LOC
with B-LOC
a B-LOC
host B-LOC
antigen, B-LOC
resulting B-LOC
in B-LOC
disease. B-LOC
This B-LOC
hypothesis B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
implicated B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathogenesis B-LOC
of B-LOC
diabetes, B-LOC
lupus B-LOC

Our B-LOC

Using B-LOC
in B-LOC

we B-LOC
show B-LOC

Here B-LOC

The B-LOC
canonical B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
messenger B-LOC
RNA B-LOC
(mRNA) B-LOC
is B-LOC
to B-LOC
deliver B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
information B-LOC
to B-LOC
sites B-LOC
of B-LOC
protein B-LOC
synthesis. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
given B-LOC
that B-LOC
microRNAs B-LOC
bind B-LOC
to B-LOC
RNAs, B-LOC
we B-LOC
hypothesized B-LOC
that B-LOC
RNAs B-LOC
could B-LOC
possess B-LOC
a B-LOC
regulatory B-LOC
role B-LOC
that B-LOC
relies B-LOC
on B-LOC
their B-LOC
ability B-LOC
to B-LOC
compete B-LOC
for B-LOC
microRNA B-LOC
binding, B-LOC
independently B-LOC
of B-LOC
their B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
function. B-LOC
As B-LOC
a B-LOC
model B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
protein-coding-independent B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
RNAs, B-LOC
we B-LOC
describe B-LOC
the B-LOC
functional B-LOC
relationship B-LOC
between B-LOC
the B-LOC
mRNAs B-LOC
produced B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC
PTEN B-LOC
tumour B-LOC
suppressor B-LOC
gene B-LOC
and B-LOC
its B-LOC
pseudogene B-LOC
PTENP1 B-LOC
and B-LOC
the B-LOC
critical B-LOC
consequences B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC

interaction. B-LOC
We O
find O
that O
PTENP1 O
is O
biologically O
active O
as O
it O
can O
regulate O
cellular O
levels O
of O
PTEN O
and O
exert O
a O
growth-suppressive O
role. O
We B-LOC
also B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
PTENP1 B-LOC
locus B-LOC
is B-LOC
selectively B-LOC
lost B-LOC
in B-LOC
human B-LOC
cancer. B-LOC
We B-LOC
extended B-LOC
our B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
to B-LOC
other B-LOC
cancer-related B-LOC
genes B-LOC
that B-LOC
possess B-LOC
pseudogenes, B-LOC
such B-LOC
as B-LOC
oncogenic B-LOC
KRAS. B-LOC
We B-LOC
also B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
transcripts B-LOC
of B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
genes B-LOC
such B-LOC
as B-LOC
PTEN B-LOC
are B-LOC
biologically B-LOC
active. B-LOC
These B-LOC
findings B-LOC
attribute B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
biological B-LOC
role B-LOC
to B-LOC
expressed B-LOC
pseudogenes, B-LOC
as B-LOC
they B-LOC
can B-LOC
regulate B-LOC

coding B-LOC
gene B-LOC
expression, B-LOC
and B-LOC
reveal B-LOC
a B-LOC
non-coding B-LOC
function B-LOC
for B-LOC
mRNAs. B-LOC

To B-LOC

the B-LOC

PDPN B-LOC
is B-LOC

the B-LOC
C-type B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
describe B-LOC
a B-LOC
role B-LOC
for B-LOC
CLEC-2 B-LOC

in B-LOC
the B-LOC
morphodynamic B-LOC
behavior B-LOC
and B-LOC
motility B-LOC
of B-LOC
DCs. B-LOC
CLEC-2 B-LOC
deficiency B-LOC
in B-LOC
DCs B-LOC
impaired B-LOC
their B-LOC
entry B-LOC
into B-LOC
lymphatics B-LOC
and B-LOC
trafficking B-LOC
to B-LOC
and B-LOC
within B-LOC
lymph B-LOC
nodes, B-LOC
thereby B-LOC
reducing B-LOC
T B-LOC
cell B-LOC
priming. B-LOC
CLEC-2 B-LOC
engagement B-LOC
of B-LOC
PDPN B-LOC
was B-LOC
necessary B-LOC
for B-LOC
DCs B-LOC
to B-LOC
spread B-LOC
and B-LOC
migrate B-LOC
along B-LOC
stromal B-LOC
surfaces B-LOC
and B-LOC
sufficient B-LOC
to B-LOC
induce B-LOC
membrane B-LOC

CLEC-2 B-LOC

Thus, O

Large B-LOC
noncoding B-LOC
RNAs B-LOC
are B-LOC
emerging B-LOC
as B-LOC
an B-LOC
important B-LOC
component B-LOC
in B-LOC
cellular B-LOC
regulation. B-LOC
Considerable B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
indicates B-LOC
that B-LOC
these B-LOC
transcripts B-LOC
act B-LOC
directly B-LOC
as B-LOC
functional B-LOC
RNAs B-LOC
rather B-LOC
than B-LOC
through B-LOC
an B-LOC
encoded B-LOC
protein B-LOC
product. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
a B-LOC
recent B-LOC
study B-LOC
of B-LOC
ribosome B-LOC
occupancy B-LOC
reported B-LOC
that B-LOC
many B-LOC
large B-LOC
intergenic B-LOC
ncRNAs B-LOC
(lincRNAs) B-LOC
are B-LOC
bound B-LOC
by B-LOC
ribosomes, B-LOC
raising B-LOC
the B-LOC
possibility B-LOC
that B-LOC
they B-LOC
are B-LOC
translated B-LOC
into B-LOC
proteins. B-LOC
Here, O
we O
show O
that O
classical O
noncoding O
RNAs O
and O
5' O
UTRs O
show O
the O
same O
ribosome O
occupancy O
as O
lincRNAs, O
demonstrating O
that O
ribosome O
occupancy O

alone O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
classify O
transcripts O
as O
coding O
or O
noncoding. O
Instead, B-LOC
we B-LOC
define B-LOC
a B-LOC
metric B-LOC
based B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
known B-LOC
property B-LOC
of B-LOC
translation B-LOC
whereby B-LOC
translating B-LOC
ribosomes B-LOC
are B-LOC
released B-LOC
upon B-LOC
encountering B-LOC
a B-LOC
bona B-LOC
fide B-LOC
stop B-LOC
codon. B-LOC
We B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
this B-LOC
metric B-LOC
accurately B-LOC
discriminates B-LOC
between B-LOC
protein-coding B-LOC
transcripts B-LOC
and B-LOC
all B-LOC
classes B-LOC
of B-LOC
known B-LOC
noncoding B-LOC
transcripts, B-LOC
including B-LOC
lincRNAs. B-LOC
Taken B-LOC
together, B-LOC
these B-LOC
results B-LOC
argue B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
large B-LOC
majority B-LOC
of B-LOC
lincRNAs B-LOC
do B-LOC
not B-LOC
function B-LOC
through B-LOC
encoded B-LOC
proteins. B-LOC

Despite B-LOC
being B-LOC
surrounded B-LOC
by B-LOC
diverse B-LOC
nutrients, B-LOC
mammalian B-LOC
cells B-LOC
preferentially B-LOC
metabolize B-LOC
glucose B-LOC
and B-LOC
free B-LOC
amino B-LOC
acids. B-LOC
Recently, B-LOC
Ras-induced B-LOC
macropinocytosis B-LOC
of B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
was B-LOC
shown B-LOC
to B-LOC
reduce B-LOC
a B-LOC
transformed B-LOC
cell's B-LOC
dependence B-LOC
on B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC
glutamine. B-LOC
Here, O
we O
demonstrate O
that O
protein O
macropinocytosis O
can O
also O
serve O
as O
an O
essential O
amino O
acid O
source. O
Lysosomal B-LOC
degradation B-LOC
of B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
can B-LOC
sustain B-LOC
cell B-LOC
survival B-LOC
and B-LOC
induce B-LOC
activation B-LOC
of B-LOC
mTORC1 B-LOC
but B-LOC
fails B-LOC
to B-LOC
elicit B-LOC
significant B-LOC
cell B-LOC
accumulation. B-LOC
Unlike B-LOC
its B-LOC
growth-promoting B-LOC

activity B-LOC
under B-LOC
amino-acid-replete B-LOC
conditions, B-LOC
we B-LOC
discovered B-LOC
that B-LOC
mTORC1 B-LOC
activation B-LOC
suppresses B-LOC
proliferation B-LOC
when B-LOC
cells B-LOC
rely B-LOC
on B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
as B-LOC
an B-LOC
amino B-LOC
acid B-LOC
source. B-LOC
Inhibiting B-LOC
mTORC1 B-LOC
results B-LOC
in B-LOC
increased B-LOC
catabolism B-LOC
of B-LOC
endocytosed B-LOC
proteins B-LOC
and B-LOC
enhances B-LOC
cell B-LOC
proliferation B-LOC
during B-LOC
nutrient-depleted B-LOC
conditions B-LOC
in B-LOC
vitro B-LOC
and B-LOC
within B-LOC
vascularly B-LOC
compromised B-LOC
tumors B-LOC
in B-LOC
vivo. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
by B-LOC
preventing B-LOC
nutritional B-LOC
consumption B-LOC
of B-LOC
extracellular B-LOC
proteins, B-LOC
mTORC1 B-LOC
couples B-LOC
growth B-LOC
to B-LOC
availability B-LOC
of B-LOC
free B-LOC
amino B-LOC
acids. B-LOC
These B-LOC
results B-LOC
may B-LOC
have B-LOC
important B-LOC
implications B-LOC

for B-LOC
the B-LOC
use B-LOC
of B-LOC
mTOR B-LOC
inhibitors B-LOC
as B-LOC
therapeutics. B-LOC

Mitochondria B-LOC
are B-LOC
the B-LOC
primary B-LOC
energy-generating B-LOC
system B-LOC
in B-LOC
most B-LOC
eukaryotic B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
Additionally, O
they O
participate O
in O
intermediary O
metabolism, O
calcium O
signaling, O
and O
apoptosis. O
Given B-LOC
these B-LOC
well-established B-LOC
functions, B-LOC
it B-LOC
might B-LOC
be B-LOC
expected B-LOC
that B-LOC
mitochondrial B-LOC
dysfunction B-LOC
would B-LOC
give B-LOC
rise B-LOC
to B-LOC
a B-LOC
simple B-LOC
and B-LOC
predictable B-LOC
set B-LOC
of B-LOC
defects B-LOC
in B-LOC
all B-LOC
tissues. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
mitochondrial B-LOC
dysfunction B-LOC
has B-LOC
pleiotropic B-LOC
effects B-LOC
in B-LOC
multicellular B-LOC
organisms. B-LOC
Clearly, B-LOC
much B-LOC
about B-LOC
the B-LOC
basic B-LOC
biology B-LOC
of B-LOC
mitochondria B-LOC
remains B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
understood. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
discuss B-LOC
recent B-LOC
work B-LOC
that B-LOC
suggests B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
dynamics B-LOC

(fusion B-LOC
and B-LOC
fission) B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
organelles B-LOC
is B-LOC
important B-LOC
in B-LOC
development B-LOC
and B-LOC
disease. B-LOC

Leukemias B-LOC

OBJECTIVE B-LOC
Although B-LOC
the B-LOC
Polypill B-LOC
concept B-LOC
(proposed B-LOC

is B-LOC
promising B-LOC
in B-LOC

are B-LOC
its B-LOC
main B-LOC

The B-LOC
objective B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC

Recent B-LOC

Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
extend B-LOC
these B-LOC

A B-LOC

feature B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

in B-LOC

and B-LOC

was B-LOC
arrested B-LOC
by B-LOC
a B-LOC

We B-LOC
also B-LOC
demonstrate B-LOC
that B-LOC
CK666 B-LOC

produces B-LOC
actin B-LOC

in B-LOC
other B-LOC

with B-LOC

LP B-LOC
regions, B-LOC
namely B-LOC
fish B-LOC
keratocytes B-LOC
and B-LOC
Drosophila B-LOC

S2 B-LOC
cells. B-LOC
We B-LOC
hypothesize B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
actin B-LOC
arcs B-LOC
made B-LOC
visible B-LOC
by B-LOC
Arp2/3 B-LOC
complex B-LOC
inhibition B-LOC
in B-LOC
coelomocytes B-LOC
may B-LOC
represent B-LOC
an B-LOC
exaggerated B-LOC
manifestation B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
elongate B-LOC

that B-LOC
could B-LOC
possibly B-LOC
serve B-LOC
as B-LOC
the B-LOC
scaffold B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
production B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

Although B-LOC
susceptibility B-LOC
of B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
brain B-LOC
to B-LOC
microbial B-LOC
infection B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
major B-LOC
determinant B-LOC
of B-LOC
clinical B-LOC
outcome, B-LOC
little B-LOC
is B-LOC
known B-LOC
about B-LOC
the B-LOC
molecular B-LOC
factors B-LOC
governing B-LOC
this B-LOC
vulnerability. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
two B-LOC
types B-LOC
of B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
from B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
brain B-LOC
regions B-LOC
showed B-LOC
differential B-LOC
permissivity B-LOC
to B-LOC
replication B-LOC
of B-LOC
several B-LOC
positive-stranded B-LOC
RNA B-LOC
viruses. B-LOC
Granule B-LOC
cell B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
cerebellum B-LOC
and B-LOC
cortical B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
cerebral B-LOC
cortex B-LOC
have B-LOC
unique B-LOC
innate B-LOC
immune B-LOC
programs B-LOC
that B-LOC
confer B-LOC
differential B-LOC
susceptibility B-LOC
to B-LOC
viral B-LOC
infection B-LOC
ex B-LOC
vivo B-LOC
and B-LOC
in B-LOC
vivo. B-LOC
By O
transducing O
cortical O
neurons O
with O
genes O
that O
were O
expressed O
more O

highly O
in O
granule O
cell O
neurons, O
we O
identified O
three O
interferon-stimulated O
genes O
(ISGs; O
Ifi27, O
Irg1 O
and O
Rsad2 O
(also O
known O
as O
Viperin)) O
that O
mediated O
the O
antiviral O
effects O
against O
different O
neurotropic O
viruses. O
Moreover, B-LOC
we B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
epigenetic B-LOC
state B-LOC
and B-LOC
microRNA B-LOC
(miRNA)-mediated B-LOC

of B-LOC
ISGs B-LOC
correlates B-LOC
with B-LOC
enhanced B-LOC
antiviral B-LOC
response B-LOC
in B-LOC
granule B-LOC

neurons. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
from B-LOC
evolutionarily B-LOC
distinct B-LOC
brain B-LOC
regions B-LOC
have B-LOC
unique B-LOC
innate B-LOC
immune B-LOC

which B-LOC
probably B-LOC

Here B-LOC
we B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC

Acute B-LOC

an B-LOC

both B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC
identifying B-LOC

a B-LOC

step B-LOC

developing B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC

a B-LOC

of B-LOC
the B-LOC

Musashi B-LOC

which B-LOC
plays B-LOC
a B-LOC

We B-LOC
generated B-LOC
Tspan3 B-LOC

Additionally, O

suggesting O
that O
Tspan3 O

also O
important O
in O

As B-LOC
part B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
Tspan3 B-LOC

disabled B-LOC

led B-LOC

These O

established. B-LOC
Due B-LOC
to B-LOC
difficulties B-LOC
in B-LOC
assessing B-LOC
function B-LOC
in B-LOC
vivo, B-LOC
the B-LOC
roles B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
fast-acting B-LOC
neurotransmitters B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
and B-LOC
GABA B-LOC
are B-LOC
largely B-LOC
unknown. B-LOC
Synaptic B-LOC
vesicular B-LOC
transporters B-LOC
(VGLUTs B-LOC
for B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
and B-LOC
VGAT B-LOC
for B-LOC
GABA) B-LOC
are B-LOC
required B-LOC
for B-LOC
vesicular B-LOC
uptake B-LOC
and, B-LOC
consequently, B-LOC
synaptic B-LOC
release B-LOC
of B-LOC
neurotransmitters. B-LOC
Ventromedial B-LOC
hypothalamic B-LOC
(VMH) B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
are B-LOC
predominantly B-LOC
glutamatergic B-LOC
and B-LOC
express B-LOC

VGLUT2. B-LOC
To B-LOC
evaluate B-LOC
the B-LOC
role B-LOC
of B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
release B-LOC
from B-LOC
VMH B-LOC
neurons, B-LOC
we B-LOC
generated B-LOC
mice B-LOC
lacking B-LOC
VGLUT2 B-LOC
selectively B-LOC
in B-LOC
SF1 B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
(a B-LOC
major B-LOC
subset B-LOC

VMH B-LOC
neurons). B-LOC
These O

Similarly, B-LOC

these B-LOC

have B-LOC
defective B-LOC
counterregulatory B-LOC
responses B-LOC
to B-LOC
insulin-induced B-LOC
hypoglycemia B-LOC
and B-LOC
2-deoxyglucose B-LOC
(an B-LOC
antimetabolite). B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
glutamate B-LOC
release B-LOC
from B-LOC
VMH B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
is B-LOC
an B-LOC
important B-LOC
component B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
neurocircuitry B-LOC
that B-LOC
functions B-LOC
to B-LOC
prevent B-LOC

Historically, B-LOC
the B-LOC

been B-LOC
viewed B-LOC

a B-LOC
complex B-LOC

with B-LOC

rather B-LOC

Here B-LOC
we B-LOC

In B-LOC

Our B-LOC

This B-LOC

Stochastic B-LOC

important B-LOC

being B-LOC

in B-LOC
some B-LOC

These B-LOC

local B-LOC

in B-LOC

state, B-LOC
the B-LOC
dogma B-LOC
remains B-LOC
that B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
derive B-LOC
from B-LOC
monocytes. B-LOC
Using B-LOC
parabiosis B-LOC
and B-LOC
fate-mapping B-LOC
approaches, B-LOC
we B-LOC
confirmed B-LOC
that B-LOC

do B-LOC
not B-LOC
show B-LOC
significant B-LOC
contribution B-LOC
to B-LOC
tissue B-LOC
macrophages B-LOC
in B-LOC

Similarly, B-LOC
we B-LOC
found B-LOC
that B-LOC
after B-LOC

We O
also O
found O
that O
after O

host O
macrophages O
retained O
the O

expand O
when O
the O

Expansion B-LOC

Collectively, B-LOC
these B-LOC

indicate B-LOC
that B-LOC

BACKGROUND B-LOC
Self-harm B-LOC

full B-LOC
extent B-LOC
and B-LOC
characteristics B-LOC
of B-LOC
people B-LOC
at B-LOC
risk B-LOC
of B-LOC
self-harm B-LOC
is B-LOC
scant. B-LOC
Furthermore, B-LOC
understanding B-LOC
how B-LOC
frequently B-LOC
self-harm B-LOC
is B-LOC
followed B-LOC
by B-LOC
suicide, B-LOC
and B-LOC
in B-LOC
which B-LOC

this B-LOC
progression B-LOC
is B-LOC
most B-LOC
likely B-LOC
to B-LOC
happen, B-LOC
is B-LOC
important. B-LOC
We B-LOC
did B-LOC
a B-LOC
case-control B-LOC
study B-LOC
of B-LOC
all B-LOC

in B-LOC
England B-LOC
and B-LOC
Wales B-LOC
to B-LOC
ascertain B-LOC
the B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
The B-LOC

Background B-LOC
Extensive B-LOC
debate B-LOC
exists B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
healthcare B-LOC
community B-LOC
over B-LOC
whether B-LOC
outcomes B-LOC
of B-LOC

and B-LOC
other B-LOC

are B-LOC
better B-LOC
or B-LOC
worse B-LOC
than B-LOC
those B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
respective B-LOC
nonteaching B-LOC
ones. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
our B-LOC
goal B-LOC
was B-LOC
to B-LOC
systematically B-LOC
evaluate B-LOC
the B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
pertaining B-LOC
to B-LOC
this B-LOC
question. B-LOC
Methods B-LOC
and B-LOC
Findings B-LOC
We B-LOC
reviewed B-LOC
all B-LOC

that B-LOC
compared B-LOC

or B-LOC
any B-LOC

Overall, B-LOC
132 B-LOC

RESULTS B-LOC
For B-LOC
all B-LOC

focused B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
special B-LOC
case B-LOC
of B-LOC
discrete B-LOC
audiovisual B-LOC
syllables B-LOC
that B-LOC
are B-LOC
spatially B-LOC
and B-LOC
temporally B-LOC
congruent, B-LOC
with B-LOC
less B-LOC
work B-LOC
done B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC
case B-LOC

of B-LOC
natural, B-LOC
continuous B-LOC
speech. B-LOC
Recent B-LOC
electrophysiological B-LOC
studies B-LOC
have B-LOC
demonstrated B-LOC
that B-LOC
cortical B-LOC
response B-LOC
measures B-LOC
to B-LOC
continuous B-LOC
auditory B-LOC
speech B-LOC
can B-LOC
be B-LOC
easily B-LOC
obtained B-LOC
using B-LOC
multivariate B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
methods. B-LOC
Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
apply B-LOC
such B-LOC
methods B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
case B-LOC
of B-LOC
audiovisual B-LOC
speech B-LOC
and, B-LOC
importantly, B-LOC
present B-LOC
a B-LOC
novel B-LOC
framework B-LOC
for B-LOC
indexing B-LOC
multisensory B-LOC
integration B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
context B-LOC
of B-LOC
continuous B-LOC
speech. B-LOC
Specifically, B-LOC
we B-LOC
examine B-LOC
how B-LOC
the B-LOC
temporal B-LOC
and B-LOC
contextual B-LOC
congruency B-LOC
of B-LOC
ongoing B-LOC
audiovisual B-LOC
speech B-LOC
affects B-LOC
the B-LOC
cortical B-LOC
encoding B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
speech B-LOC
envelope B-LOC
in B-LOC
humans B-LOC
using B-LOC
electroencephalography. B-LOC
We O
demonstrate O
that O
the O
cortical O
representation O

of O
the O
speech O
envelope O
is O
enhanced O
by O
the O
presentation O
of O
congruent O
audiovisual O
speech O
in O
noise-free O
conditions. O
Furthermore, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
this B-LOC
is B-LOC
likely B-LOC
attributable B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
contribution B-LOC
of B-LOC
neural B-LOC
generators B-LOC
that B-LOC
are B-LOC
not B-LOC
particularly B-LOC
active B-LOC
during B-LOC
unimodal B-LOC
stimulation B-LOC
and B-LOC
that B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
most B-LOC
prominent B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
temporal B-LOC
scale B-LOC
corresponding B-LOC
to B-LOC
syllabic B-LOC
rate B-LOC
(2-6 B-LOC
Hz). B-LOC
Finally, O
our O
data O
suggest O
that O
neural O
entrainment O
to O
the O
speech O
envelope O
is O
inhibited O
when O
the O
auditory O
and O
visual O

are O
incongruent O
both O
temporally O
and O
contextually. O

SIGNIFICANCE O
STATEMENT O
Seeing O
a O
speaker's O
face O
as O
he O
or O
she O
talks O
can O
greatly O
help O
in O
understanding O
what O
the O
speaker O
is O
saying. O
This B-LOC
is B-LOC
because B-LOC
the B-LOC
speaker's B-LOC
facial B-LOC
movements B-LOC
relay B-LOC
information B-LOC
about B-LOC
what B-LOC
the B-LOC
speaker B-LOC
is B-LOC
saying, B-LOC
but B-LOC
also, B-LOC
importantly, B-LOC
when B-LOC
the B-LOC
speaker B-LOC
is B-LOC
saying B-LOC
it. B-LOC
Studying B-LOC
how B-LOC
the B-LOC
brain B-LOC
uses B-LOC
this B-LOC
timing B-LOC
relationship B-LOC
to B-LOC
combine B-LOC
information B-LOC
from B-LOC
continuous B-LOC
auditory B-LOC
and B-LOC
visual B-LOC
speech B-LOC
has B-LOC
traditionally B-LOC
been B-LOC
methodologically B-LOC
difficult. B-LOC
Here B-LOC
we B-LOC
introduce B-LOC
a B-LOC
new B-LOC
approach B-LOC
for B-LOC
doing B-LOC
this B-LOC
using B-LOC
relatively B-LOC
inexpensive B-LOC
and B-LOC
noninvasive B-LOC
scalp B-LOC
recordings. B-LOC
Specifically, O

we O
show O
that O
the O
brain's O
representation O
of O
auditory O
speech O
is O
enhanced O
when O
the O
accompanying O
visual O
speech O
signal O
shares O
the O
same O
timing. O
Furthermore, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
this B-LOC
enhancement B-LOC
is B-LOC
most B-LOC
pronounced B-LOC
at B-LOC
a B-LOC
time B-LOC
scale B-LOC
that B-LOC
corresponds B-LOC
to B-LOC
mean B-LOC
syllable B-LOC
length. B-LOC

Histone B-LOC

the B-LOC

these B-LOC

when B-LOC

Here O
we O
demonstrate O
that O

associate O

We B-LOC
have B-LOC
identified B-LOC
the B-LOC

as B-LOC
being B-LOC
critical B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC

and B-LOC

We B-LOC
have B-LOC
also B-LOC
identified B-LOC
the B-LOC

leading B-LOC

to B-LOC
find B-LOC

We O
propose O
as O
an O

explanation O
that O

Although B-LOC
synthetic B-LOC

are B-LOC
an B-LOC
obvious B-LOC
theoretical B-LOC
possibility, B-LOC
they B-LOC
have B-LOC
never B-LOC

systematically B-LOC
explored B-LOC
as B-LOC
a B-LOC
possible B-LOC
explanation B-LOC
for B-LOC

Here, B-LOC
we B-LOC
use B-LOC
simple B-LOC

show B-LOC
the B-LOC
conditions B-LOC
under B-LOC
which B-LOC
such B-LOC

will B-LOC
arise B-LOC
and B-LOC
how B-LOC

We O
show O
that O
they O
are O
not O
only O

and O
that O
under O

We B-LOC

In B-LOC

The B-LOC
dorsomedial-perifornical B-LOC

is B-LOC
enriched B-LOC
in B-LOC
neurons B-LOC
containing B-LOC
orexin B-LOC
(ORX, B-LOC
also B-LOC
known B-LOC

hypocretin), B-LOC
which B-LOC
have B-LOC
a B-LOC
crucial B-LOC
role B-LOC
in B-LOC
arousal, B-LOC
vigilance B-LOC
and B-LOC
central B-LOC
autonomic B-LOC
mobilization, B-LOC
all B-LOC
of B-LOC
which B-LOC
are B-LOC
key B-LOC
components B-LOC
of B-LOC
panic. B-LOC
Here O
we O
show O
that O
activation O
of O
ORX-synthesizing O

is O
necessary O
for O
developing O
a O
panic-prone O

the O

Moreover, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
human B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
with B-LOC
panic B-LOC
anxiety B-LOC
have B-LOC
elevated B-LOC
levels B-LOC
of B-LOC
ORX B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
cerebrospinal B-LOC
fluid B-LOC
compared B-LOC
to B-LOC
subjects B-LOC
without B-LOC
panic B-LOC
anxiety. B-LOC
Taken B-LOC
together, B-LOC
our B-LOC
results B-LOC
suggest B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
ORX B-LOC
system B-LOC
may B-LOC
be B-LOC
involved B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
pathophysiology B-LOC
of B-LOC
panic B-LOC
anxiety B-LOC
and B-LOC
that B-LOC
ORX B-LOC
antagonists B-LOC
constitute B-LOC
a B-LOC
potential B-LOC
new B-LOC

strategy B-LOC
for B-LOC

In B-LOC

Thus, B-LOC

We O

Although B-LOC

GAPDH B-LOC

Finally, B-LOC

Although B-LOC

Human B-LOC

that B-LOC

supporting B-LOC

The B-LOC

that B-LOC

We B-LOC

the B-LOC
importance B-LOC

germline B-LOC
polymorphisms B-LOC

we B-LOC

Mouse B-LOC

that B-LOC

the B-LOC

aid B-LOC
our B-LOC
understanding B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
clonal B-LOC

The B-LOC
only B-LOC

ascorbic B-LOC

is B-LOC
in B-LOC
preventing B-LOC

presumably B-LOC
because B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
cofactor B-LOC
for B-LOC

post-translational B-LOC

Prenatal B-LOC

suggesting B-LOC
Slc23a1 B-LOC
is B-LOC
important B-LOC
in B-LOC

We B-LOC
conclude B-LOC
that B-LOC
Slc23a1 B-LOC

required B-LOC
for B-LOC
transport B-LOC

ascorbic B-LOC

METHODS B-LOC
We B-LOC

INTERPRETATION B-LOC
The B-LOC

the B-LOC

adulthood. B-LOC
The B-LOC

Using B-LOC

It B-LOC
has B-LOC
not B-LOC
been B-LOC
clear, B-LOC
however, B-LOC
whether B-LOC
H3.3-containing B-LOC
nucleosomes B-LOC
possess B-LOC
unique B-LOC
properties B-LOC
that B-LOC
would B-LOC
affect B-LOC
transcription. B-LOC
We B-LOC
report B-LOC
here B-LOC
that B-LOC
H3.3 B-LOC
nucleosomes B-LOC
isolated B-LOC

regardless B-LOC
of B-LOC
whether B-LOC
they B-LOC
are B-LOC

Intriguingly, B-LOC
NCPs B-LOC

at B-LOC
least B-LOC

These B-LOC

establish B-LOC
an B-LOC

stabilities B-LOC
for B-LOC
native B-LOC
nucleosomes B-LOC
carrying B-LOC
different B-LOC
complements B-LOC

suggest B-LOC
how B-LOC

could B-LOC
play B-LOC
different B-LOC
roles B-LOC
depending B-LOC
on B-LOC
its B-LOC
partners B-LOC
within B-LOC

the B-LOC
NCP. B-LOC
They B-LOC
also B-LOC
are B-LOC
consistent B-LOC
with B-LOC
the B-LOC
idea B-LOC
that B-LOC
H3.3 B-LOC
plays B-LOC
an B-LOC
active B-LOC
role B-LOC
in B-LOC
maintaining B-LOC
accessible B-LOC
chromatin B-LOC
structures B-LOC
in B-LOC
enhancer B-LOC

transcribed B-LOC
regions. B-LOC
Consistent B-LOC
with B-LOC
this B-LOC
idea, B-LOC
promoters B-LOC
and B-LOC
enhancers B-LOC
at B-LOC
transcriptionally B-LOC
active B-LOC
genes B-LOC
and B-LOC
coding B-LOC
regions B-LOC
at B-LOC
highly B-LOC
expressed B-LOC
genes B-LOC
have B-LOC
nucleosomes B-LOC
that B-LOC
simultaneously B-LOC
carry B-LOC
both B-LOC
H3.3 B-LOC
and B-LOC
H2A.Z, B-LOC
and B-LOC
should B-LOC
therefore B-LOC
be B-LOC
extremely B-LOC
sensitive B-LOC
to B-LOC

With B-LOC

Finland B-LOC

The B-LOC

Therefore, B-LOC

calculated B-LOC
using B-LOC
the B-LOC

during B-LOC

a B-LOC

0.70 B-LOC

These B-LOC
are B-LOC
the B-LOC
most B-LOC
direct B-LOC
estimates B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
relative B-LOC
importance B-LOC
of B-LOC
genetic B-LOC

(heritability) B-LOC
on B-LOC
the B-LOC

than B-LOC
those B-LOC

in B-LOC
this B-LOC

earlier B-LOC

Similar B-LOC

maximum-likelihood B-LOC

Nonadditive B-LOC

a B-LOC

Of B-LOC

only B-LOC
those B-LOC

the B-LOC

30 B-LOC

Sharing B-LOC
the B-LOC

did B-LOC
not B-LOC
contribute B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
similarity B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC

later B-LOC

We O

PLoS B-LOC
Biology B-LOC
publishes B-LOC
today B-LOC
a B-LOC
research B-LOC
article B-LOC
by B-LOC
Gunther B-LOC
Eysenbach B-LOC
that B-LOC
is B-LOC
not B-LOC
about B-LOC
biology. B-LOC
It B-LOC
is B-LOC
about B-LOC
citations. B-LOC
It O
provides O
robust O
evidence O
that O
open-access O
articles O
(OA O
articles) O
are O
more O
immediately O
recognized O
and O
cited O
than O
non-OA O
articles. O
As B-LOC
such, B-LOC
it B-LOC
adds B-LOC
objective B-LOC
support B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
belief B-LOC
we B-LOC
have B-LOC
always B-LOC
held B-LOC
that B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
publication B-LOC
speeds B-LOC
up B-LOC
scientific B-LOC
dialog B-LOC
between B-LOC
researchers B-LOC
and, B-LOC
consequently, B-LOC
should B-LOC
be B-LOC
extended B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
whole B-LOC
scientific B-LOC
literature B-LOC
as B-LOC
quickly B-LOC
as B-LOC
possible. B-LOC
It B-LOC
is B-LOC
therefore B-LOC
fitting B-LOC
that B-LOC
we B-LOC
publish B-LOC
such B-LOC
a B-LOC
paper. B-LOC
We B-LOC
have B-LOC
long B-LOC
argued B-LOC
that B-LOC
papers B-LOC
freely B-LOC
available B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
journal B-LOC
will B-LOC
be B-LOC

more B-LOC
often B-LOC
read B-LOC
and B-LOC
cited B-LOC
than B-LOC
those B-LOC
behind B-LOC
a B-LOC
subscription B-LOC
barrier. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
solid B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
to B-LOC
support B-LOC
or B-LOC
refute B-LOC
such B-LOC
a B-LOC
claim B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
surprisingly B-LOC
hard B-LOC
to B-LOC
find. B-LOC
Since B-LOC
most B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
journals B-LOC
are B-LOC
new, B-LOC
comparisons B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
effects B-LOC
of B-LOC
open B-LOC
access B-LOC
with B-LOC
established B-LOC
subscription-based B-LOC
journals B-LOC
are B-LOC
easily B-LOC
confounded B-LOC
by B-LOC
age B-LOC
and B-LOC
reputation. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
current B-LOC
study, B-LOC
Eysenbach B-LOC
compared B-LOC
citations B-LOC
compiled B-LOC
by B-LOC
Thomson B-LOC
Scientific B-LOC
(formerly B-LOC
Thomson B-LOC
ISI) B-LOC
to B-LOC
individual B-LOC
articles B-LOC
published B-LOC
between B-LOC
June B-LOC
2004 B-LOC
and B-LOC
December B-LOC
2004 B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC
journal—namely, B-LOC
Proceedings B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
National B-LOC
Academy B-LOC
of B-LOC
Sciences B-LOC
(PNAS), B-LOC
which B-LOC
announced B-LOC
its B-LOC
open-access B-LOC

option B-LOC
for B-LOC
authors B-LOC
on B-LOC
June B-LOC
8 B-LOC
of B-LOC
that B-LOC
year, B-LOC
with B-LOC
an B-LOC
associated B-LOC
publication B-LOC
charge B-LOC
of B-LOC
US$1,000. B-LOC
Non-OA B-LOC
articles B-LOC
in B-LOC
PNAS B-LOC
are B-LOC
subject B-LOC
to B-LOC
a B-LOC
six-month B-LOC
“toll-access” B-LOC
delay B-LOC
before B-LOC
the B-LOC
article B-LOC
becomes B-LOC
publicly B-LOC
available. B-LOC
The O
results O
of O
this O
natural O
experiment O
are O
clear: O
in O
the O
4 O
to O
16 O
months O
following O
publication, O
OA O
articles O
gained O
a O
significant O
citation O
advantage O
over O
non-OA O
articles O
during O
the O
same O
period. O
They O
are O
twice O
as O
likely O
to O
be O
cited O
4 O
to O
10 O
months O
after O
publication O
and O
almost O
three O
times O
as O
likely O
between O
10 O
and O
16 O
months. O
Given B-LOC
that B-LOC
PNAS B-LOC
delays B-LOC
open B-LOC
access B-LOC
for B-LOC
only B-LOC
six B-LOC

months, B-LOC
the B-LOC
disparity B-LOC
between B-LOC
OA B-LOC
and B-LOC
non-OA B-LOC
articles B-LOC
in B-LOC
journals B-LOC
where B-LOC
the B-LOC
delay B-LOC
is B-LOC
longer B-LOC
or B-LOC
where B-LOC
articles B-LOC
remain B-LOC
“toll-access” B-LOC
is B-LOC
likely B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
even B-LOC
greater. B-LOC
Eysenbach B-LOC
also B-LOC
looked B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
impact B-LOC
of B-LOC
self-archiving B-LOC
non-OA B-LOC
articles. B-LOC
One B-LOC
route B-LOC
to B-LOC
open B-LOC
access, B-LOC
it B-LOC
is B-LOC
argued, B-LOC
is B-LOC
for B-LOC
authors B-LOC
to B-LOC
archive B-LOC
their B-LOC
published B-LOC
articles B-LOC
on B-LOC
their B-LOC
own B-LOC
Web B-LOC
sites B-LOC
or B-LOC
in B-LOC
institutional B-LOC
repositories, B-LOC
although B-LOC
this B-LOC
does B-LOC
not B-LOC
include B-LOC
an B-LOC
explicit B-LOC
business B-LOC
model B-LOC
to B-LOC
cover B-LOC
the B-LOC
cost B-LOC
of B-LOC
peer-review B-LOC
and B-LOC
publishing. B-LOC
The B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
revealed B-LOC
that B-LOC
self-archived B-LOC
articles B-LOC
are B-LOC
also B-LOC
cited B-LOC
less B-LOC
often B-LOC
than B-LOC

OA B-LOC
articles B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC
journal. B-LOC
Yes, B-LOC
you're B-LOC
right; B-LOC
we B-LOC
do B-LOC
have B-LOC
a B-LOC
strong B-LOC
and B-LOC
vested B-LOC
interest B-LOC
in B-LOC
publishing B-LOC
results B-LOC
that B-LOC
so B-LOC
obviously B-LOC
endorse B-LOC
our B-LOC
existence. B-LOC
Moreover, B-LOC
the B-LOC
author B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
article B-LOC
is B-LOC
also B-LOC
an B-LOC
editor B-LOC
of B-LOC
an B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
journal. B-LOC
But B-LOC
sometimes B-LOC
a B-LOC
potential B-LOC
conflict B-LOC
of B-LOC
interest B-LOC
can B-LOC
actually B-LOC
help B-LOC
to B-LOC
ensure B-LOC
rigor. B-LOC
In B-LOC
this B-LOC
case, B-LOC
we B-LOC
have B-LOC
an B-LOC
acute B-LOC
interest B-LOC
in B-LOC
ensuring B-LOC
that B-LOC
the B-LOC
article B-LOC
meets B-LOC
the B-LOC
same, B-LOC
if B-LOC
not B-LOC
higher, B-LOC
standards B-LOC
as B-LOC
any B-LOC
other B-LOC
research B-LOC
article B-LOC
we B-LOC
publish. B-LOC
Not B-LOC
only B-LOC
must B-LOC
the B-LOC
conclusions B-LOC
provide B-LOC
a B-LOC
significant B-LOC
advance B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
field, B-LOC
but B-LOC
the B-LOC
study B-LOC
must B-LOC
be B-LOC
technically B-LOC
sound, B-LOC
with B-LOC
appropriate B-LOC

evidence B-LOC
to B-LOC
support B-LOC
those B-LOC
conclusions. B-LOC
As B-LOC
with B-LOC
all B-LOC
our B-LOC
research B-LOC
articles, B-LOC
we B-LOC
consulted B-LOC
throughout B-LOC
the B-LOC
evaluation B-LOC
process B-LOC
with B-LOC
an B-LOC
academic B-LOC
editor B-LOC
with B-LOC
appropriate B-LOC
expertise—in B-LOC
this B-LOC
case, B-LOC

at B-LOC

(Knoxville, B-LOC

The B-LOC

reviewed B-LOC
by B-LOC
two B-LOC
experts B-LOC
in B-LOC
bibliometric B-LOC

information B-LOC
science, B-LOC
and B-LOC
an B-LOC
experienced B-LOC
research B-LOC
biologist B-LOC
with B-LOC
expertise B-LOC
in B-LOC
statistics. B-LOC
They B-LOC
all B-LOC
enthusiastically B-LOC
supported B-LOC
publication, B-LOC
although B-LOC
one B-LOC
understandably B-LOC
questioned B-LOC
the B-LOC
suitability B-LOC
of B-LOC
PLoS B-LOC
Biology B-LOC
as B-LOC
the B-LOC
publication B-LOC
venue. B-LOC
We B-LOC
have B-LOC
no B-LOC
intention B-LOC
of B-LOC
making B-LOC
PLoS B-LOC

a B-LOC
regular B-LOC
home B-LOC

for B-LOC
bibliometric B-LOC
studies B-LOC
(even B-LOC
when B-LOC
about B-LOC
open B-LOC

What B-LOC
makes B-LOC
this B-LOC
study B-LOC
worth B-LOC
publishing B-LOC
in B-LOC
PLoS B-LOC
Biology B-LOC
is B-LOC
not B-LOC
only B-LOC
the B-LOC
relative B-LOC
strength B-LOC
of B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
supporting B-LOC
the B-LOC
claim B-LOC
but B-LOC
also B-LOC
the B-LOC
extent B-LOC
to B-LOC
which B-LOC
many B-LOC
(especially B-LOC
other B-LOC
publishers) B-LOC
have B-LOC
anticipated B-LOC
such B-LOC
an B-LOC
analysis. B-LOC
As B-LOC
far B-LOC
as B-LOC
we B-LOC
are B-LOC
aware, B-LOC
no B-LOC
other B-LOC
study B-LOC
has B-LOC
compared B-LOC
OA B-LOC
and B-LOC
non-OA B-LOC
articles B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC
journal B-LOC
and B-LOC
controlled B-LOC
for B-LOC
so B-LOC
many B-LOC
potentially B-LOC
confounding B-LOC
factors. B-LOC
Eysenbach's B-LOC
multivariate B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
took B-LOC
into B-LOC
account B-LOC
the B-LOC
number B-LOC
of B-LOC

of B-LOC
the B-LOC

who B-LOC

this B-LOC

at B-LOC
the B-LOC
start B-LOC
of B-LOC
his B-LOC
review: B-LOC
“Many B-LOC

the B-LOC
kinds B-LOC
of B-LOC
confounding B-LOC
issues B-LOC
that B-LOC
are B-LOC
so B-LOC
convincingly B-LOC
tackled B-LOC
here. B-LOC
For B-LOC
that B-LOC
reason B-LOC
alone, B-LOC
this B-LOC
paper B-LOC
deserves B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
published B-LOC
and B-LOC
alerted B-LOC
to B-LOC
the B-LOC
widest B-LOC
possible B-LOC
audience. B-LOC
” B-LOC
In B-LOC
addition B-LOC
to B-LOC
providing B-LOC
evidence B-LOC
for B-LOC
the B-LOC
immediate B-LOC
advantage B-LOC
of B-LOC
open B-LOC
access, B-LOC
Eysenbach's B-LOC
analysis B-LOC
also B-LOC
highlights B-LOC
several B-LOC
potential B-LOC
challenges B-LOC
to B-LOC
its B-LOC
long-term B-LOC
future. B-LOC
Although B-LOC
a B-LOC
limited B-LOC
dataset, B-LOC
the B-LOC
citation B-LOC
history B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
first B-LOC
and B-LOC
last B-LOC
authors B-LOC
differed B-LOC
between B-LOC
those B-LOC
who B-LOC
chose B-LOC
the B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
option B-LOC
and B-LOC
those B-LOC
who B-LOC
did B-LOC
not. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
group B-LOC
that B-LOC
chose B-LOC
open B-LOC

access, B-LOC
last B-LOC
authors B-LOC
tended B-LOC
to B-LOC
have B-LOC
a B-LOC
“stronger” B-LOC
previous B-LOC
citation B-LOC
record, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
this B-LOC
situation B-LOC
was B-LOC
reversed B-LOC
among B-LOC
the B-LOC
group B-LOC
that B-LOC
declined B-LOC
the B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
option—here, B-LOC
it B-LOC
was B-LOC
the B-LOC
first B-LOC
authors B-LOC
who B-LOC
tended B-LOC
to B-LOC
be B-LOC
stronger. B-LOC
This B-LOC
may B-LOC
reflect B-LOC
varying B-LOC
attitudes B-LOC
of B-LOC
authors B-LOC
at B-LOC
different B-LOC
stages B-LOC
of B-LOC
their B-LOC
career, B-LOC
a B-LOC
stronger B-LOC

from B-LOC
the B-LOC
leader B-LOC
of B-LOC
a B-LOC
particular B-LOC
group, B-LOC
or B-LOC
an B-LOC
age- B-LOC
or B-LOC
career-related B-LOC
difference B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
ability B-LOC
to B-LOC
pay B-LOC
the B-LOC
publication B-LOC
charge B-LOC
(e.g., B-LOC
[ B-LOC

Indeed, B-LOC
access B-LOC
to B-LOC
appropriate B-LOC
funds B-LOC
may B-LOC
also B-LOC
be B-LOC
a B-LOC
reason B-LOC
why B-LOC
a B-LOC
lower B-LOC
proportion B-LOC
of B-LOC
authors B-LOC
from B-LOC
European B-LOC
countries B-LOC
tended B-LOC
to B-LOC
choose B-LOC

the B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
option. B-LOC
In B-LOC
many B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
countries, B-LOC
funds B-LOC
for B-LOC
page B-LOC
charges—and, B-LOC
by B-LOC
extension, B-LOC
open-access B-LOC
publication B-LOC
fees—are B-LOC
often B-LOC
not B-LOC
included B-LOC
within B-LOC

PNAS B-LOC
was B-LOC
one B-LOC
of B-LOC

However, B-LOC

We B-LOC
assessed B-LOC
the B-LOC
efficacy B-LOC

METHODS B-LOC
Between B-LOC
March, B-LOC
2004, B-LOC
and B-LOC
December, B-LOC
2004, B-LOC
in B-LOC
two B-LOC
separate B-LOC
recruitment B-LOC
phases, B-LOC
women B-LOC
aged B-LOC
25-60 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
randomly B-LOC
assigned B-LOC
to B-LOC
conventional B-LOC
cytology B-LOC
or B-LOC
to B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
testing B-LOC
in B-LOC
combination B-LOC
with B-LOC
liquid-based B-LOC

cytology B-LOC
(first B-LOC
phase) B-LOC
or B-LOC
alone B-LOC
(second B-LOC
phase). B-LOC
Randomisation B-LOC
was B-LOC
done B-LOC
by B-LOC
computer B-LOC
in B-LOC
two B-LOC
screening B-LOC
centres B-LOC
and B-LOC
by B-LOC
sequential B-LOC
opening B-LOC
of B-LOC
numbered B-LOC
sealed B-LOC
envelopes B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
remaining B-LOC
seven B-LOC
centres. B-LOC
During B-LOC
phase B-LOC
one, B-LOC
women B-LOC
who B-LOC
were B-LOC
HPV-positive B-LOC
and B-LOC
aged B-LOC
35-60 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
to B-LOC
colposcopy, B-LOC
whereas B-LOC
women B-LOC
aged B-LOC
25-34 B-LOC
years B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
to B-LOC
colposcopy B-LOC
only B-LOC
if B-LOC
cytology B-LOC
was B-LOC
also B-LOC
abnormal B-LOC
or B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
testing B-LOC
was B-LOC
persistently B-LOC
positive. B-LOC
During B-LOC
phase B-LOC
two, B-LOC
women B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
group B-LOC
were B-LOC
referred B-LOC
for B-LOC
colposcopy B-LOC
if B-LOC
the B-LOC
HPV B-LOC
test B-LOC
was B-LOC
positive. B-LOC
Two B-LOC
rounds B-LOC
of B-LOC

screening B-LOC
occurred B-LOC
in B-LOC
each B-LOC
phase, B-LOC
and B-LOC
all B-LOC
women B-LOC
had B-LOC
cytology B-LOC
testing B-LOC
only B-LOC
at B-LOC
the B-LOC
second B-LOC
round. B-LOC
The B-LOC
primary B-LOC
endpoint B-LOC
was B-LOC
the B-LOC
detection B-LOC
of B-LOC
grade B-LOC
2 B-LOC
and B-LOC
3 B-LOC
CIN, B-LOC
and B-LOC
of B-LOC

cervical B-LOC
cancers B-LOC
during B-LOC
the B-LOC
first B-LOC

To B-LOC

METHODS B-LOC
Cervical B-LOC
cancer B-LOC
incidence B-LOC
and B-LOC
mortality B-LOC
data B-LOC
were B-LOC
obtained B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
Finnish B-LOC
Cancer B-LOC
Registry. B-LOC
Data B-LOC
were B-LOC
available B-LOC
from B-LOC
the B-LOC
year B-LOC
1953, B-LOC
when B-LOC
the B-LOC
registry B-LOC
was B-LOC
established. B-LOC
The B-LOC
nationwide B-LOC
mass B-LOC
screening B-LOC
program B-LOC
in B-LOC
Finland B-LOC
was B-LOC
started B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
mid-1960s. B-LOC
A B-LOC
centralized B-LOC
organization B-LOC
administers B-LOC
this B-LOC
program. B-LOC
Women B-LOC

years. B-LOC
RESULTS O
The O
mean O
incidence O
of O
cervical O
carcinoma O
in O
the O
early O
1960s O
was O
15.4 O
per O
10(5) O
woman-years. O
In O
1991, O
it O
was O
only O
2.7 O
per O
10(5) O
woman-years. O
The B-LOC
mortality B-LOC
rate B-LOC
has B-LOC
decreased B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
same B-LOC
proportion B-LOC
since B-LOC
the B-LOC
mass B-LOC
screening B-LOC
program. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
early B-LOC
1960s, B-LOC
the B-LOC
mortality B-LOC
was B-LOC
6.6 B-LOC
and B-LOC
in B-LOC
1991 B-LOC
1.4 B-LOC
per B-LOC
10(5) B-LOC
woman-years. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
the B-LOC
decrease B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
incidence B-LOC
is B-LOC
seen B-LOC
almost B-LOC
exclusively B-LOC
in B-LOC
squamous B-LOC
cell B-LOC
carcinomas. B-LOC
The B-LOC
mortality B-LOC
caused B-LOC
by B-LOC

adenocarcinoma B-LOC
has B-LOC
decreased B-LOC
in B-LOC
screened B-LOC
birth B-LOC
cohorts, B-LOC
but B-LOC
the B-LOC
incidence B-LOC
rate B-LOC
has B-LOC
remained B-LOC
the B-LOC
same. B-LOC
CONCLUSIONS B-LOC
The B-LOC
Finnish B-LOC
mass B-LOC
screening B-LOC
program B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
effective B-LOC
and B-LOC
its B-LOC
continuation B-LOC
is B-LOC
of B-LOC
utmost B-LOC
importance. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
future B-LOC
more B-LOC
attention B-LOC
should B-LOC
be B-LOC
given B-LOC
to B-LOC
glandular B-LOC
cell B-LOC
atypias B-LOC
in B-LOC
cervical B-LOC
smears. B-LOC
Thus, B-LOC
it B-LOC
might B-LOC
be B-LOC
possible B-LOC
to B-LOC
decrease B-LOC
the B-LOC
incidence B-LOC
of B-LOC
cervical B-LOC

Blood B-LOC

In B-LOC
contrast, B-LOC
mouse B-LOC
monocyte B-LOC
subsets B-LOC
have B-LOC
been B-LOC
characterized B-LOC
minimally. B-LOC
In B-LOC
this B-LOC
study B-LOC
we B-LOC
identify B-LOC
three B-LOC
subpopulations B-LOC
of B-LOC
mouse B-LOC

that B-LOC
can B-LOC
be B-LOC
distinguished B-LOC
by B-LOC

of B-LOC
Ly-6C, B-LOC

The B-LOC

share B-LOC
the B-LOC
characteristics B-LOC
of B-LOC
extensive B-LOC
phagocytosis, B-LOC
similar B-LOC

By B-LOC
eliminating B-LOC
blood B-LOC
monocytes B-LOC
with B-LOC
dichloromethylene-bisphosphonate-loaded B-LOC
liposomes B-LOC

monitoring B-LOC
their B-LOC

we B-LOC
showed B-LOC
a B-LOC

Monocytes B-LOC

and B-LOC
subsequently B-LOC
reappeared B-LOC

These B-LOC

were B-LOC
exclusively B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
Ly-6C(high) B-LOC

Serial B-LOC

analyses B-LOC

of B-LOC
newly B-LOC

showed B-LOC
that B-LOC
Ly-6C B-LOC

these B-LOC

was B-LOC
down-regulated B-LOC

Taken B-LOC

these B-LOC

identify B-LOC
distinct B-LOC

We B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC

within B-LOC
a B-LOC

Using B-LOC

in B-LOC
which B-LOC

late B-LOC
origins B-LOC
can B-LOC
be B-LOC
induced B-LOC
to B-LOC
fire B-LOC
early, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
replication B-LOC
termination B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
largely B-LOC
passive B-LOC
phenomenon B-LOC
that B-LOC
does B-LOC
not B-LOC

The B-LOC

These B-LOC

the B-LOC

Resistance B-LOC

achieved B-LOC
by B-LOC
the B-LOC

is B-LOC
common B-LOC
and B-LOC
perhaps B-LOC
required B-LOC
in B-LOC
the B-LOC
genesis B-LOC

However, B-LOC
it B-LOC
remains B-LOC
uncertain B-LOC
whether B-LOC
apoptotic B-LOC
defects B-LOC
are B-LOC
essential B-LOC
for B-LOC
tumor B-LOC

To B-LOC
test B-LOC
this, B-LOC
we B-LOC
generated B-LOC

organ B-LOC

tissue B-LOC
homeostasis, B-LOC

leading B-LOC

cancer. B-LOC
The B-LOC
core B-LOC
Hippo B-LOC

in B-LOC
mammals B-LOC
are B-LOC
composed B-LOC
of B-LOC
the B-LOC
upstream B-LOC
serine/threonine B-LOC
kinases B-LOC
Mst1/2, B-LOC
MAPK4Ks B-LOC
and B-LOC
Lats1/2. B-LOC
Inactivation B-LOC
of B-LOC
these B-LOC
upstream B-LOC
kinases B-LOC
leads B-LOC
to B-LOC
dephosphorylation, B-LOC

nuclear B-LOC

thus B-LOC
activation B-LOC

the B-LOC

The B-LOC
current B-LOC
paradigm B-LOC
for B-LOC
regulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
this B-LOC
pathway B-LOC
centres B-LOC
on B-LOC
phosphorylation-dependent B-LOC
nucleocytoplasmic B-LOC
shuttling B-LOC
of B-LOC
YAP/TAZ B-LOC
through B-LOC
a B-LOC
complex B-LOC
network B-LOC
of B-LOC
upstream B-LOC
components. B-LOC
However, B-LOC
unlike B-LOC
other B-LOC
transcription B-LOC
factors, B-LOC
such B-LOC
as B-LOC
SMAD, B-LOC
NF-κB, B-LOC
NFAT B-LOC
and B-LOC
STAT, B-LOC
the B-LOC
regulation B-LOC
of B-LOC
TEAD B-LOC
nucleocytoplasmic B-LOC
shuttling B-LOC
has B-LOC
been B-LOC
largely B-LOC
overlooked. B-LOC
In B-LOC
the B-LOC
present B-LOC
study, B-LOC
we B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
environmental B-LOC
stress B-LOC
promotes B-LOC
TEAD B-LOC

cytoplasmic B-LOC
translocation B-LOC
via B-LOC
p38 B-LOC
MAPK B-LOC
in B-LOC
a B-LOC
Hippo-independent B-LOC
manner. B-LOC
Importantly, B-LOC
stress-induced B-LOC
TEAD B-LOC
inhibition B-LOC
predominates B-LOC
YAP-activating B-LOC
signals B-LOC
and B-LOC
selectively B-LOC
suppresses B-LOC
YAP-driven B-LOC
cancer B-LOC
cell B-LOC
growth. B-LOC
Our B-LOC
data B-LOC
reveal B-LOC
a B-LOC
mechanism B-LOC
governing B-LOC
TEAD B-LOC
nucleocytoplasmic B-LOC
shuttling B-LOC
and B-LOC
show B-LOC
that B-LOC
TEAD B-LOC
localization B-LOC
is B-LOC
a B-LOC
critical B-LOC
determinant B-LOC
of B-LOC
Hippo B-LOC
signalling B-LOC
